<|title|>A game where someone has to coordinate other playersThe game I'm thinking of wouldn't be too big.  Imagine a clash royale style game with the same spawn mechanics, except the soldiers are other players.  It would probably need a more mazelike map so that the commander needs to give them more information and coordination matters. There would be only around 3 fighter, one based around range, one on melee, and one in between, kind of like splatoons roller, sniper, and normal weapons.  You could also have someone on the towers if you wanted. There would have to be longer mana wait times to compensate for the lack of players. The tower system could probably work around the same way as clash, where you have to destroy at least one first before you win.<|endoftext|><|title|>FPS Shooter* 2 factions Magic and Guns* The factions allow you to mix and match equipment in that class (Like a Tank healer, or Speed gunner)* You design your own character similar to gta but less realistic kinda like that Final Fantasy MMO<|endoftext|><|title|>DOS/Command Prompt Interactive Puzzle GameI have been contemplating a puzzle game which is mostly played through a DOS like command prompt interface where the only input type is the keyboard. DOS was my first true "Computer" experience, which is a reason I am thinking that this idea might be interesting, though, I don't know if the current generation of gamers will find it so.Basically, like other "Found Phone" games, or "Her Story" type of games, there is a mystery that is unraveled by searching a computer, and because it is the 80s, DOS is the OS of the times. The game comes with a "User Manual" listing commands that the player can type to navigate through the file system, fix issues, read e-mail, chat, log on to bulletin boards and run executables and all other things that were done in that era. In addition to story clues, folders will also contain hidden Easter eggs, mini games and references to the 80s.The graphics, and logic for this game should not be a challenge, however, the story should be interesting and engaging enough to keep the player typing away on that command prompt, which means tens or hundreds of pages of text (and many16 color images).Any thoughts on this?<|endoftext|><|title|>Inn owning sim, need more ideasI'm working on a game with the idea that you own an inn and you keep financially stable with customers, rooms, workers, etc. (This idea wasn't my own, but I AM programming it) does anyone have any ideas to expand upon this? I currently have made all of the base code(no graphics, just white squares) and the game is quite dull. This is what the game currently hasYou can see a small blackboard with a list of favours is you hold the 'B' key, and holding TAB will get you other stats such as the time of day, your current money, your family's contentedness, etc. During day hours customers come in and you need to choose whether they should do you a favour to subtract one from your blackboard, or if they should just pay you outright. By the end of each day you must have a blackboard with all favours completed. If there are not enough rooms for a customer you must turn them away (you can do this even with rooms available, but there's really no point in doing so) As more customers arrive, your shop popularity goes up, causing customers to come in more steadily and offer more money. At the end of each day, which is dictated by when your randomized daytime hours hit 0, a menu opens which will allow you to choose to feed your family, advertise your inn, or buy more space for your it. You can probably imagine what these all do to their respective variables. How can I make this more entertaining?<|endoftext|><|title|>Rhytm game mechanics.Hi!

DON'T WANT TO READ:---Raw : Level reset every few weeks(or more or accord to dev preferrences) , but many stuff remains since only the level will be reseted.____From previous feedback ; most said(and agrees-based on upvotes from similar opinion) MMO is always about progressing forward.____The problem with current system in my opinion:It iss hard to make low level places populated again. At max level , people start to look at other activity and eventually burnout(purely personal opinion).New expansion focused at end game create a discouraging experience for newbies.When PvP balance kicks in , often they ignore the early gameplay for the affected target. But props to certains games that provides pve and pvp section.Same as above , but major patch for recent(2013++) games hardly pull an extensive ecosystem balance that affect the game as whole , because most feedbacks and gameplay data is obtained and also for everything beyond early games.* for this problem some dev goes for sloppy solutions and obliterate the pacing...and obstruct the roleplayability right from the start by overly rewarding the newbies so they wont spot all the blunders and skip straight to the post-early games.(Retarded opinion)Level locking elements is sooooo 2008. Why would we keep this distracting elements? Even after obtaining some level locked stuffs , lets say a weaponary. You will still need to work on them afterall. Now we have so many options to replace this mechanism. Looking how some instanced stuff under similar system is now dying and mismanaged badly. It is safe to say level locking AND LEVEL REQUIREMENT is a such distracting element for replayability of anything that a game could offer.* current solution for this matter which often used in many mmo : The normal difficulities for Dungeon A is for level 1 - 3. For Hard is 7- 11 .... and so on. So , Dungeon A will always be busy with players!---My raw suggestion on how to pull it!(like an example)Basically we want to lower down the level cap , but will carefully assign the experience so it still take a few hours to reach max level solo. Proggression is capped not by level , but how much they can proggress between each reset is locked by level cap. Means , there few things that remains after resetting! In this example , level reset is every two weeks and level capped at 15 and takes 6 days to reach cap solo. End game - realm pvp...The Presumable Pros of Level Reset.* it can bring the unlimited leveling.* quicker access to end game.* allowing different direction to leveling ; experimental.    * e.g. main quest is branching and always. Doesn't dictate whole leveling speed , can be ignored.* and for actual newbies they will always be companied by the experienced!* (from my example above) the veteran still a road ahead of everyone else on each reset. And proggression continues for everyone.<|endoftext|><|title|>A game about seeing how the player reacts to phobiasThe game is VR and you go through various stages based on phobias.

The other duelist has a limited time to push right button to defend and then it is its turn to attack. The first one has to answer to what the other did and it gets faster and faster or the time you have to push right button is the time the other one took to do his defense + attack.You can also choose to push same type than the attack: for example make a R defense when the other made a R attack. The blades collide, the limited time is reinitialised and the R S P are randomly moved on other buttons.Another thing could be some characters would have 2 attacks and in the same way you have to do two defenses<|endoftext|><|title|>Haunted Aim TrainerIt's like Doki Doki Literature Club but with an aim trainer like Kovaak or Aimgod instead of a visual novel.<|endoftext|><|title|>VN where the the text is subtext.One thing that bothers me about VNs is how the text description of beautiful sceneries end up being pointless since most of the time the visuals already let you form your own conclusions. What if the text did the opposite. Maybe you have an extremely biased narrator who describes scenes in the wrong way intentionally. Maybe he's incredibly pessimistic and the text is just how he feels. You could even make it such that the background scenery is swapped with an ugly one when he starts narrating(since you're seeing things from his perspective) and it swaps back when he stops ranting. The immediate contrast would be very noticeable.You can extend this to characters as well. In a certain scene in Nisemonogatari, a female character tries to seduce the MC. The camera reflects her desire and shows her in seductive angles. But when the camera cuts to the MCs perspective, he sees her normally and the camera reflects that. This may be cinematography 101(or not, I don't watch movies that much) but it can be done with VNs as well. Use visuals to show the other person's perception of herself while the narrator narrates normally. Another thing you could do is to rewind the text. The Narrator could be trying to remember something. He starts of by saying that Event A happened like this and after going for a while he stops that line of thought. The text will then disappear backwards to represent that. This could also be used to illustrate a character's thought process during an investigation.Lastly, one thing that I really liked about Depression Quest is how it displays unavailable choices. You could display that the MC cannot make and maybe describe his logic for not being able to do so when you try to pick that choice. You can even lie about that. Maybe the MC thinks he can't do something but picking the crossed choice will force him to think logically and realize that he can actually do it.I really do think VNs are an underused medium. There are many ways to utilize it but most of the time we settle for the tried and tested method of storytelling.<|endoftext|><|title|>super mario galaxy: revenge of the comets[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Af3xci7Kz\_0zV8v3EuzBQQUPHUudTNC23X0ZrVHDRqk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Af3xci7Kz_0zV8v3EuzBQQUPHUudTNC23X0ZrVHDRqk/edit)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPZNIzyezZmPP3UGH8n3Y8GEtledSDyG03\_2BMoMBiw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPZNIzyezZmPP3UGH8n3Y8GEtledSDyG03_2BMoMBiw/edit)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhfb-6HWXpRdRfd7bKxDFKYq4eXJkUQMwor1qpgt4rk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhfb-6HWXpRdRfd7bKxDFKYq4eXJkUQMwor1qpgt4rk/edit)<|endoftext|><|title|>The game that i've been thinking aboutHey guys, I am new to reddit so forgive me if I don't understand how these things work so well...But   in short term, I am posting on a few subreddits this message to help   get ideas from the gaming community to create this game that I am   planning on developing and releasing to the public. As you will read, I   have not even smoothed out the finer details of this game, but it is   more of a vague general idea and vision that I thought about last night   (I also had a dream about it the night before, is that weird?).And   with that, I am taking to these forums to be elaborated on further by   you guys to help me bring this idea to reality. Because I heard that   reddit is the best place to go for that... Any tips on how to use reddit   would be helpful too lol.**What is the genre of the game**The   game will be "classified" as a horror game, but in reality I am   planning something out of the traditional calm, eerie, ominous, satanic   style that almost every horror game follows...Below   is a note that I handwrote in a notebook that was intended to be only   for myself when I was having a vision of the game. So keep that in  mind,  this note was not written to go public, but instead was a raw  scribbled  explanation that I wrote to myself before considering asking  peopple on  reddit about it.  It was written word to word, with no stop  for me to  think about what I was planning or going to write , it was  pure free  minded description.**The Note**I envision a gameA game with horror elements, this game will be about riddles and level based, which is built to be completely horrifying.The   basic premise is a game with different levels, in each level there is a   riddle that must be solved, this riddle can be solved by looking for   clues scattered across the level, but it won't be easy. You will be   chased by an crazed psychopath.**Monster**I   envision a person who is slim and someone who resembles a creepypasta   character, more specifically Jeff The Killer. Pure crazed voice. when  in  a confrontation they will scream "I'm coming for you!" and "Here I   come!" in a frantic manner, building in intensity over time or when he   gets closer. His voice will not sound dark and bassy, but more   higher-pitched screeching to add a distinct feeling of psychopathic   craziness that other games do not have.His   body will be hunched over and his movement will resemble a waddle. His   neck and head will be crooked, somewhat resembling The Crooked Man.  And  when spurred with a chase sequence the player will receive flashes  of  red and dark light, with after visuals \[of the flashes\] resembling  that  of a flashbang, with lagging and stretching images \[due to  uncoordinated  mental processing, as well as atmospheric suspense\]. As  the monster  gets closer to the player the red lights will occur more  prevalent and  of higher intensity, kind of like the flashing red lights  on a police  vehicle, as the voice simultaneously rises in prevalence  and intensity,  escalating to a seemingly uncontrollable scream. The  music that will  play will be abrupt, loud, and distorted chinging  noises, resembling the  pitch of a counter bell on a desk. This will be  accompanied by a  tension rising sound effect (with frequencies  specifically designed for  high tension situations) that also raises in  intensity as the monster is  near.What I  am trying to create is a  very nightmarish emotionally fueled horror  game based on natural  reactions of psychology that will take an  emotional toll on the player  through the rise of disturbing sounds and  intensity at the peak of high  tension. Pushing the limits of any other  horror game I've seen. This is  not a horror game, but one of pure  terror and anxiety. A very riskful  experience leading to a new type of  "horror" in video games. No really  jumpscares, just PURE intensity and  terror of the unknown coupled with  disturbing sounds and imagery.  Designed to cause psychological  uneasyness.<|endoftext|><|title|>I had a few ideasI had quite a few ideas for new video games that i posted in R/Gaming but im sure no one saw my posts and i think R/Gameideas is a better subreddit for my ideas anyways.I appreciate your time if ya care to look through my posts, they are all full fledged ideas for new video games with desired features.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4l3ilb/i_want_a/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkreddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4l7hxk/i_think_a/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkreddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4kx1fo/i_want/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkreddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4l1p9y/here_we_go_again/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkreddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4kqwgo/i_want_a/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link<|endoftext|><|title|>Strategie Game DevelopmentI thought about a game that combines the "Map" and Regiment/Army movement from Napolen TW but in real time.

You have to gain the trust of others Regiment, your people in the Regiment, other Comanders and Generals!This Game should play in the Time around Napolen. Your Faktion/Emperor/King is KI. It decide if your Faktion is ready for war. Also the highes General (maybe you) helps him with that!The map movement should be like Mount and Blade Warband. If you "only" controll one Regiment, you go with a General that decide where to go. All Comanders and General have there own trust system with each other!

The only difference is you have a "boost" button you can occasionally use to power-up your climbing/ramming/hopping abilities. For example, you could use hold "boost" while you hop to do a mid-air jump in case you need to save yourself from falling off the world.####Oh, yes, you can fall off the racetrack.The game features abstract, floating racetracks. There are usually walls/obstacles of varying height at either side to prevent cars from falling off, but they're too short to save any careless cars at the top of the stacks.There is no way to get "in front of the pack" in a sense; there will always be racecars ahead of you... like they are just a part of the track.

It would feel [like this](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/02/article-2441450-1875778E00000578-966_964x640.jpg).There would be mushrooms, ambient mobs like snakes and bats as well as monsters deeper underground.The objective would be to get as deep as possible within different world seeds. Every world seed that has been generated by someone would have a winner with the current max depth reached recorded.The player would have a pickaxe, a torch helmet, some tnt, a pontoon, a tent, ropes and other climbing equipment.The survival aspect is also important. It would include heat, moisture, hunger and energy management.<|endoftext|><|title|>A section of a game where your high leveled character needs to fear beginning enemies againThis isn't really a specific idea but I think it would be a good way to humble a player that's lost perspective. You know how in games everyone is a scared villager that's afraid of a monster that you take out easily? You know how near endgame, many enemies become trivial and you wade through them? I think it would be neat to create an endgame section where the player gets their tools stripped from them sombra emp style or something and they become genuinely afraid/ challenged by beginning enemies they previously didn't care about. A good example of this is the anime Goblin Slayer. The average adventurer thinks of goblins as this trivial low level enemy but they're actually horrific from a villager point of view. I'm not sure how you'd implement this but I think it'd be a nice change of pace, maybe it's a trap from a nemesis meant to humiliate you or something.<|endoftext|><|title|>Kingdom MMORPGImagine having a game where you pick roles so like. 2 roles I can think of right now would be like king and general.

Control parts of the map, the general and king could spawn soldiers in. Become allies with countries. Have war. But this would all be from a first person view not a tactical third person MObile based game. This would be for PC and extremely in depth RPG. Open your kingdom. Close your kingdom. Interact with the other players to secure your kingdom. Invade other lands. Defend against attacks. Deal with kingdom issues. A huge RP aspect would be applied and each role would have a lot of specific duties and interactions throughout the castle and kingdom. Being able to actually do these things would be pretty important. I just had a dream that’s actually how I got this idea. I had magic powers as the king. And I am able to control my dreams. We were getting invaded and I had to suspect that we have corruption in the kingdom we had to defend against attacks and stuff it was truly amazing and it would make a game of the year really.

So, without further ado, let's get into where I sort of took inspiration from:I'm thinking gameplay similar to the likes of Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life. However, instead of crafting your own video games and youtube videos, the player is making computer viruses to unleash upon the internet.I think the endgame would probably be something along the lines of Plague Inc / Pandemic 2: infect the majority of the world with your computer viruses until no survivors are left.The graphical style of the game doesn't have to be anything special: again similar to Game Dev Tycoon / Youtubers Life - maybe a little more futuristic.Of course, the game would probably include an upgrade / research mechanic, in which the player could unlock the ability to make different types of viruses (worms, trojans, ransomware, etc.), or be able to research or unlock different components to include in their viruses; Just like Game Dev Tycoon, the player would be able to customize each computer virus to their liking.The player may also have to deal with not being caught by the police as an added mechanic. The player may do this by implementing anti-tracking software into their viruses, or by upgrading a certain skill.The only problem I see with this  is how to make a currency system work within the context of the game, since most viruses don't exactly generate money.Also, I imagine there would have to be a disclaimer placed somewhere within this game , since computer viruses are a pretty touchy subject.Tell me if there are any other flaws that this game might have, any ideas you might want to add on, etc. I have had this idea in my head for a long time and am happy to share it with Reddit. Thank you for reading!<|endoftext|><|title|>[A rough sidequest idea for an RPG] The Fertility TrapThe character ends up on an island. Not on a deserted one, frankly quite the opposite. An unspecified while ago a supernatural disaster of some sorts wiped out the entirety of the island’s male population, leaving the women to adopt an amazonlike way of living, but also to die out slowly. Sounds like your typical amazon fantasy, where a hero comes in and basically becomes the village’s breeding stallion, right? Well, as the tropes say, All Men Are Perverts, and by extension all gamers obviously are. As the branches of the isle’s quest unveil, the player is allowed to heroically contribute to ‘solving the village’s dwindling population problem’. Still sounds like a typical amazon fantasy for you? Here’s the catch – when the final arc of the sidequest nears its end, the character has to fight the level’s boss - the isle’s goddess of fertility, who gets progressively stronger buffs depending on the amount of time the player decided to spend detracting from the main plot, up to an almost absolute annihilation had he prioritized reproducing over the actual goals. What do you guys think - a different idea for a scaling boss, maybe a deconstruction of the popular view on the topic of sex in games, maybe something else? <|endoftext|><|title|>Pokemon kart racing game, already posted in r/pokemonhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/d19oi8/idea_for_a_pokemon_kart_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app<|endoftext|><|title|>Can't pick between two ideas.Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I can't think of any other.

The zoological theme park’s attractions are prehistoric animal, brought back from different time periods and the park’s name is Primeval Park. Gameplay:The player’s main objective is to create a zoological theme park with prehistoric animals as its main attractions and make it popular. It is necessary to add feeders, infrastructure that will supply food for your creatures within enclosure. However, creatures will have other needs too and they can also feed on external sources of food asides from the feeders. To add to your park’s population of prehistoric creatures, you must retrieve one from the past. To obtain creatures, one must send a team of Paleontologists through a time portal and pick a specific location and the geologic period. This is because some locations have multiple creatures from different time periods, allowing the player to choose the time period of a certain area they wish to obtain creatures from. The team will return with creatures of varying ages, even sometimes returning with the eggs of oviparous creatures. Attractions and amenities are also needed. Creatures:The creatures in the game are prehistoric creatures. The creatures will have scientifically accurate designs and they will be sexually dimorphic. There is also the chance of creatures with albinism and melanism. Each creature requires a unique biosphere, meaning that the shape of exhibits, materials used, ecology, plants, elevation and humidity will play a key role whether the creatures will survive. Some creatures will even require different climates and oxygen levels, which means the player can build indoor exhibits. These creatures can mate and produce offspring, as well as perform natural behaviors. Consultation:Paleontologists should consult upon the development of the creatures in game, including their behavior, design, environmental requirements etc. Teams:The player has teams of paleontologists, which the player sends through the time portal to a certain area and the time period to retrieve creatures of random ages. Players are able to send more than one team to a single area. Having more teams in an area increases the chance of getting eggs, albino and melanistic creatures. During the start of the game, the player has 1 team. As the park becomes more popular, players have the option to hire more teams. Rarity:Creatures with albinism and melanism are rarer to find, with more teams increasing the chance of finding these creatures. Some eggs may yield albino creatures and melanistic creatures. Hiring:You can hire certain professions that will assist in your park, some of which can only be unlocked once you have bought certain infrastructure. The worse your park is, the worse the hired people are and the better your park is, the better the hired people are. First person modeThere is a first person mode that will allow you to explore your park, empty trash cans ,talk to guests about their preferences and wishes for the park and talk to staff. But if you are killed by a rampaging creature, you revert back to the top down view of the game. Modes of Gameplay:There is only one mode of gameplay, akin to a campaign mode, but you cannot “lose” as you can simply practice methods that will help you get back visitors nor truly complete the game, as you have the option to just continue building your park after making it popular. Visitors:Visitors can be tapped to find their input on the park and what to improve. Visitors have unique wishes and names. Island of the Primordial:The Island of the Primordial is a large jungle island with a climate similar to Saint Lucia’s climate. Your park will have no building limits and population limit for creatures within enclosures and the park itself. Rampaging:Occasionally, creatures will escape their enclosure and many will attack guests. There are specific staff to subdue the creatures and transport them back to their enclosures. <|endoftext|><|title|>Hall MonitorOne of my favorite games is Papers Please, where the premise is pretty much people come through the line at an immigration checkpoint and give you papers, and you have to see if they have all the valid documents. My game idea is similar in the primary mechanic, but more abstract when it comes to the setting.Your job is to patrol the school for kids that aren't supposed to be in the hall. On your first day, you're only chosen to monitor one hallway. As the game progresses, administration gives you more of the school to monitor, but since you have more work you can either a) be allowed to miss more kids, as you can't be everywhere, or b) set up other kids as posts to help you monitor the school. The game takes place over a set amount of time (30 days/ levels, maybe more)Once you find a kid in the hall, you interrogate them, they give you a hall pass (each classroom has a different hall pass, and you have to see if its valid or not, this is the primary inspiration from Papers Please). If they have a valid pass, great. If not, you can write them up, or they may run, and you have to chase them before they go inside the bathroom, their classroom, etc. Chasing them down could lead to not interrogating other kids in the hall. Some kids may give you a sob story, or have a "valid" excuse as to why they don't need a pass. Whether or not you believe them is up to you. However, if you miss a kid, or let one go that shouldn't be let go, a teacher may come out of a classroom and tell you that they never get their permission, getting you in trouble. So, you have to predict certain teachers' behavior as you progress (some may not care, some are very very strict).There can also be an overarching story in the game. Maybe there is a clique in the school that tries to abuse your powers, either through threats or bribes to make sure they don't get tickets. Whether or not you let them operate is your choice.Tell me what you think, typing it all out makes it sound a lot like Papers Please but maybe that's just because it's inspired off of it. Hopefully I added something more that isn't just a reskin of that game.<|endoftext|><|title|>Started working on the idea I posted a while ago. I need your suggestions.Here is the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/ida54w/a_first_person_shooter_in_pitch_darkness/). &gt; The player must shoot terrorists in pitch dark. He has an ability which  will help him. He can shoot sonar pulses which travel and illuminate the  position of terrorists and obstacles just for a moment. Terrorists can  move in the dark, and player too must move in the dark and guess the  layout. He can only use certain amount of sonar pulses every level. I have improved the original idea for the game based on the comments. It would be of a great help if you can comment your suggestions. I am thinking to go with the name "alpha six going dark". I don't know if I can use that name. May be I will modify it to "charlie four going dark".Here is the first look:[https://youtu.be/4TXUys4Lucg](https://youtu.be/4TXUys4Lucg)<|endoftext|><|title|>Minecraft dungeons, but not procedurally generatedThis is an idea I've had for a while, before Minecraft dungeons was a thing, but I never got around to it.You complete dungeons that are hand-crafted with a group of friends and can collect materials like Ores. During a dungeon, you cannot craft or cook, but only fight. Dungeon bosses have a small chance of dropping unique items which have cool skins and special bonuses.I'm not sure about the skill system. The combat system would be fairly active (so no static spell casting). I'm in doubt about 2 possible combat systems:1. The item you hold determines your skills. There are for example shields that create projectile absorbing spheres, and others that provide AoE damage reduction when activated. There are swords that do fire damage, or can call in thunder with enough charge. The most special weapons would be special drops, while craftable weapons are fairly vanilla in terms of effects.2. It's a skill based system, where you can capture special "elite" skills from dungeon bosses which are very powerful. Kind of like Guild Wars 1.In the central hub, you can spend your collected materials to craft the more basic weapons, and you can also cook food that gives certain bonuses, like Zelda: BotW.Does this sound like fun?<|endoftext|><|title|>Undertale Remake by CD Projekt Red/ObsidianSimilar to original game, but with 3 more areas: a forest area, sky area, and a city before Asgore’s castleEach area is roughly the size of a quarter of New Vegas’s map, with the city before Asgore’s castle being the size of NovigradEach area will have about 5-6 hours of main quest stuff and 3-4 hours of side questsLike any CDPR game, side quests affect the main quest,Combat system will have 2 options1: Traditional system with added mechanics 2: ATB based action systemFrisk will have dialogue options that can lead to different thingsRomance options will be present (No sex for obvious reasons)Major characters will have more side quests that affect them.

Anyway I got to thinking of this after playing Mount and Blade Bannerlord.&amp;#x200B;It's a smallish game, played in a browser hopefully, and desktop.  I would like it to be 3d simple low poly style, but 2d would work just as well.&amp;#x200B;It's a Frankenstein creation of games like Stronghold:Kingdoms, Port Royale, Tropico 2, Pirates of the Burning Sea MMORPG, and mobile city building games like Clash of Clans and Rise of Kingdoms.The game board is an empty ocean, with some static obstacles and whatnot so it's not so boring.  The whole thing is broken up into a hierarchy of territories.  At the base there is a port city/fortress that controls the immediate territory around it.  5 or so players will have their island in that territory, and each week vote one of their own to be the governor of that territory.  This person controls their island, and the capital.  Being a governor shouldn't give much of an advantage over other players, but act as leadership role.People can create a faction/clan, if they have 5 or so territories connected, they can make it a province, designating one of those territories as the capital.  A couple of provinces come together to make a kingdom.  Each players individual level effects the government building.  the territory capital gains 5% of whatever each individual player produces, but it's not taken away from the player.  The governor uses these resources to upgrade defenses and benefits for that territory.  One line of upgrades could increase farming by 1%/2%/3% and so on.  Or they could purchase an 8 hour attack increase or something like that.  I'm not too sure about the structuring, but that's the basic mechanic.&amp;#x200B;Also for pvp, players can only attack the territory capital, or once it's destroyed there's a period of time where the individual islands can be attacked before it's repaired.&amp;#x200B;The player controls their ship/convoy from the world map for long distances, or in an arcade-y 3rd person style, preferably all in one scene, just zoomed way in, or way out.  Not so realistic and more mmorpg tab targeting style.  In the open sea you sail up to an enemy, click to target them and you slowing auto attack with cannons.  With a few activated skills to speed up combat and make it more fun.  There will be plenty of npcs roaming around, and npc islands.  Or it's a fish/whale/sunken treasure node.  Maybe a few players can meet up at one and start an instanced dungeon/mission. Navigating dangerous waters, fighting, and liberating pirate treasure.  Players can also do trading from port to port, at least to allied/neutral ports.&amp;#x200B;Back to the player island.  It'll be like a mobile city builder, or Tropico 2.  I'm not 100% sure on this, because to balance everything would be a nightmare, but players make resource gatherers, workshops, and other buildings.  There will be more finished goods than allowable buildings, so a player may be able to mine/smelt iron, and make finished iron products, but will have to import some wood/lumber or another resource to make higher tier items, because there's not enough room to harvest and process everything.&amp;#x200B;My idea is for just a regular old game.  No premium currency, or speed ups or anything like that.  I think It would be a pretty fun game, but there's a few problems I can already see.  The biggest one being people playing multiple accounts.  It would be easy and a huge benefit.  The only real non invasive way of combating this I think is to require all raw materials to be gathered manually.  Players have to send their ship on a lumber expedition to a island node, and wait 10 minutes or something for it to return.  Still wouldn't stop it, but make it slightly more inconvenient.  Maybe go with a passive resource collection, but ban accounts that only feed resources for free to a player.  Would be hard to implement and enforce though, I think.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, a basic game play snap shot:  I produce rum, nails, and ship masts on my island.  I set them to auto sell over 20 units.  The surplus is sold at my territory capital, with the price fluctuating based on the surplus.  I can also load them onto my ship sell them else where.  On my way I spot a pirate and take them down, they had some plunder and other stuff I take.  I reach my destination, and sell some rum.  Nobody in that territory produces it, so I made some cash$.  The governor of the province I'm in is gathering people to raid a neighboring city because their provinces fort is destroyed.  10 of us meet up and sail over to raid.  We got the fort down to 50% health before most of us died or ran because they gathered a defense.  I managed to make it back to our territory and I was safe, because our province capital was still intact.  We got some rewards based on the damage our group did, but nothing compared to if we destroyed it.I go back to my regular activities when I'm invited to chat with my king and other province leaders.  Our enemy is fighting another war on their other side, and offered to give us that territory in return for 10 days of peace.  Due to being active and contributing, they want to set me up as governor of the new territory.  My island is moved to where the old governor is, and I'm declared governor for the next 12 days with voting disabled.  The old governor and some of the other players moved somewhere in their territory.  I've become acquainted with the remaining players, and the new ones that joined and I think they'll continue to vote for me.<|endoftext|><|title|>Realistic Military Missions FPSThis game would have two teams and they have to accomplish specific tasks.

I used to have all these great and fantastical ideas that could have been extremely good games as a kid, but as I've gotten older, my creativity has kind of gone away. Today, though, on almost 36 hours of little to no sleep, it's back in full force. I want this game in my head to be reality, but I haven't the know-how to make it happen. Let me lay it on you. Do keep in mind, the entire idea is still in infancy, and I'm only just fleshing out the BEGINNING of the script. My expertise is in writing, so this may just turn into a book, but I want it to be very decision driven.   BASIC PREMISE: You are an antimage, an elite military unit designated to fight witches and warlocks in humanity's war against mages. The entire game is revolved around 2 things - an excellent story, which I am currently hammering down, and combat fluidity. I envision it would take HEAVY combat influence from Dark Souls and The Witcher 3. During fights, you will need to think about the environment - not only how it will affect you, but how you will affect it. Collateral damage to farmland, structures, roads, etc. will lower your already lowly reputation, as the common folk mostly see you as part of the mage problem. From time to time, you may encounter non magical humans who may want to assault/kill you. It is up to you to find non-lethal ways to dispatch them, or to slaughter them senselessly and face the associated consequences. PLOT: You're being sent South to your nation's capital to track down and kill Sage, the leader of the mage resistance. Along the way, you will meet Godfrey, your handler, and Rosric, a representative of the merchant's guild. (As well as a myriad of other characters I haven't fleshed out yet) Along the way, you'll find that this war has blurred battle lines, as it seems that mages, witches, and warlocks have penetrated deep into the nation's lands. Sage himself is in the city planning something BIG. It is your job it either stop it... or perhaps to join him. ENEMIES: As an Anti-Mage, your job is to kill witches and warlocks. These are extremely high power mages that have taken in so much mana they are barely human anymore. Normal mages are not your duty to kill, but you may find that collecting bounties on them may fetch some coin. Unlike a normal mage, witches and warlocks will all have unique abilities, all of which must be accounted for before engaging them. These powerful enemies may increase the chance of a battle having collateral damage, which is something to look out for. An example is I've already heavily fleshed out a witch who uses her own blood as a weapon. Mid way through the fight, she will sprout wings made of blood and become capable of a wind attack that can blow structures over. There will also be a myriad of magical creatures to hunt, as the empire doesn't like magic existing right under its nose. These will range from Dragons to cats with illusionary capabilities.WEAPON SYSTEM: You are an anti-mage, which means you are bound to a magical relic that you use to fight. In this case, it's a pair of gauntlets that can fire spearheaded chains made of shadows moderate distances. They also make excellent melee weapons. As you play, you will unlock new techniques. Just as well, defeating Witches and Warlocks will award you with a rune which you can take to an arcanist to forge into a runeplate you can put into one of your gauntlet's 2 rune slots. These runes will fundamentally modify how the weapons work or the capabilities of the weapons. Example: I've fleshed out an earthen rune which will allow the player to use the shadow chains to pull up sections of the earth to use as shields, or to throw enemies off their feet. COMBAT: The entire game is built around the combat system. As stated before, I envision the combat to be similar to Dark Souls/The Witcher. What will set the combat here apart is acrobatic capability and of course, high-impact environmental destruction. When against a Witch or Warlock, a player should feel as though they are evenly matched with them, and that a decisive strike from either party would kill the other. I haven't quite thought about what happens if you die. Probably load back to whatever autosave you were previously at. So, I think I got everything I want to post here for now. I'll conclude with some problems with the idea:\&gt; I do not know how to code/animate/really anything related to game design. I'd be down to write/creatively direct this project, but it's kind of dead if I couldn't get the resources to make it happen.\&gt; The combat system in my head is incredibly complex, and I'm not sure players would take to it all that well. It would be up to a dev team to simplify the controls as much as possible without losing gameplay. \&gt; Environmental destruction is important to the idea, however some may find it frustrating, and the technology available may not like it. There is is! Any encouragement/criticism of the idea would be greatly appreciated!<|endoftext|><|title|>[Abstract] Endless tower jump game with enemy possessionSorta like doodle jump when it comes to climbing higher with platformsEnemies (that are random to each replay) will show up every dozen steps that are required to be possessed in order progressEach enemy (or enemy type) would have a ability to create a different type of platform ice enemy -&gt; slippery platformrocket enemy -&gt; single boost high jumpone that lets you copy an ability you used from a few dozen steps ago (with a constantly updating list of the which abilities you used the past ten dozen steps) (won't stack with high jump ability)And then make a leaderboard for high score and those who score near you<|endoftext|><|title|>Spy network gameHi,my fist post here. I am playing around with a detective/spy game idea and would appreciate any input, critique, etc.***Please suggest interesting game mechanics***1. Time: turn-based.2. Objective: uncover an unknown network of persons (about 10-15 hierarchically connected persons).3. Start: The nodes (persons) and edges (aquitances) are pre-generated but hidden to the player. A single low-key node is uncovered. This initial lead may be connected to other persons, most importantly the case officer (immediate boss). The case officer is connected, among others, to a senior (next boss). The senior is connected to a mastermind (ultimate boss), etc.Portraits and discovered personal details are generated and shown to the player. New information is added each turn, some of it is irrelevant. Some of it is indicative of the network.Game field is a network of nodes arranged by the player is a order that encourages theoretizing about the hidden network and the role of the known nodes therein.***All results are stochastic, with chances of success bias by actions***4. Player actions (each cost a resource, e.g. manpower or time)Surveillance of a person costs a resource (agent) and has a random chance of revealing an anonymous contact (node). Putting connected persons under surveillance simultaneously may reveal their mutual link. Otherwise probable links must be verified by further surveillance.Surveillance may uncover evidence that can be used to turn a person. Blackmail, if successful, will turn the person who may then, depending on their position, reveal a portion of the network.5. (AI Enemy) Network actions (from more to least likely)Discover or suspect surveillance and stay put to hide aquitances for some whileDiscover or suspect surveillance and fake connectionsProactively fake connectionsVoluntarily defect and turn6. Game ends when the top node (the mastermind) is discovered or turned. Overall game score is reported.What do you think?<|endoftext|><|title|>I'm really inspired by Factorio, and am planning on making a sim game from scratch as my new project.

Back in high school, we used Unity, but for my class in college, we're writing for a C# terminal. It's a lot easier to use than writing in the Unity script too and I been working on something for the last week as a gift to my dad, who played a lot of Zork and other text based adventure games.It's simply called Puzzle Power and if you could guess by the title of this post, it's a puzzle game with elements of a texted based adventure. Basically, you move through a bunch of rooms with varying puzzles and different inputs for what you can check and interact with. Like in the first room, you can read a note that gives you a hint to check the walls, and then you take the numbers on those walls to crack the padlock on the door to the next room.It's a bit simple in structure and I've only got two rooms down so far, but there are going to be plenty more.

It would be a 20 car race. It would have car creation and mod support so the player can buid the vehicle to his/her taste. And they can build thier vehicle to the spec of the track. Example: An ice track would mean building the vehicle to a winter spec with tires that have retractable spikes for better grip in icy conditions. Think of split second but in VR but way more action oriented. I mean the track/environment would be the biggest obstacle you will face. It would be single and multiplayer. Single player with bots. Also maybe co-op with you and friend in the passenger seat to warn you of dangers ahead. I would have it to play with either controller or a racing wheel. Just look up split second on YouTube and you will see the raw intensity of the races.<|endoftext|><|title|>Bloodborne II: ReawakeningBloodborne 2: Reawakening I must note than I am aware no plans are currently in motion for FromSoftware to make a sequel to Bloodborne. This is just an idea that’s been bouncing around my brain cage for a while because I’m a huge fan of the game. After the Nightmare released in Yharnam was defeated by the Nightmare Hunter, remaining Hunters gathered where the Nightmare Hunter originated from and began a new guild of Hunters trained in new techniques devised from improved weaponry, their own developing expertise with beasts, and advancements in technology brought about by the better understanding of electricity and its uses. Out of this new understanding of electricity came various experiments into its potential. Some experiments are simply aesthetic while others are of a darker, much more terrifying variant. Out of the new Hunters’ Guild came a gathering of scientists devoted to medical practices many believed too similar the usage of blood in Yharnam which brought about the horrific deformations of its citizens and the Nightmare itself. The scientists continued on with their experiments, in spite of protests from both the Hunters and locals citizens, believing that their work could improve the human condition by understanding the body and mind, reanimate the dead, and even create life. While they did become more aware of how electricity flows through the human body, affecting mind and muscle alike, their delving into the creation of life only brought about grotesque and horrible creatures the likes of which could not be found even in the Nightmare. So the experiments stopped—or so they thought. A cult of scientists abandoned the Hunters’ Guild and continued their work in secret, kidnapping, maiming, murdering, whatever they could to test their newfound knowledge. Not long after this cult began their work, Hunters began awakening in the Dream again. The Nightmare Hunter having defeated the evil lingering over Gehrman, the First Hunter, they thought the Dream lost forever. Upon reawakening in the Dream they discover the Workshop rebuilt and the Doll old and tattered, even seeming distant and inattentive.Why are the Hunters suddenly finding themselves in the Hunters’ Dream again? Why is the Doll so different now than it was before despite everything else seeming as it was? Could this be linked to the Cult’s experiments? I had thought that maybe Bloodborne 2 could be more about vampires, delving deeper into the Cainhurst story but I think Vampires have been done to death at this point so I decided to keep in with the “horror” theme that Bloodborne had, the Lovecraftian and classic movie-monster feel of people turning into Werewolves and that sort but instead trying for a Frankenstein’s Monster/Dawn of the Dead theme.  Having hordes of plagued villagers coming at the player, exploring terrible laboratories where terrifying experiments have gone awry and that kind of thing. The setting would be only slightly different from Bloodborne(and even Dark Souls has some of these same variants in all three games) where it wouldn’t keep to this safe-zone of closed-in abandoned cities, ruins, creepy forests, and cliff-side areas but making the game feel more open and natural by having farmland-themed areas and creepier areas like maybe a carnival that was attacked by one of the Cult’s experiments. Something like that. I just feel like FromSoftware kind of keeps to the same basic areas over and over again which never cease to be aesthetically pleasing or boring to explore but I just feel like there are other areas we could have in the games.Note about the “Nightmare Hunter”: (Spoiler about the third ending to Bloodborne)This “Nightmare Hunter” is so-named by the Hunters after they stopped awakening in the Dream. Since Hunters only kept awakening in the dream after their deaths because of the Moon Presence they would assume that ONE of the hunters did in fact defeat whatever it was(they would have had no idea since only one of them could collect the umbilical cords) keeping the Dream going. So they named this unknown hunter the Nightmare Hunter and assume that he/she either died or is still alive somewhere. They have no idea that in defeating the Moon Presence the hunter that defeated the Moon Presence achieved transcendence and became a Celestial God, which is the reason why the Doll in the Dream now is closed-in and unfriendly, she’s been driven mad by the growing god she hid beneath the rebuilt workshop which would be the final boss.Hunters would no longer be gathering Blood Echoes anymore but rather Notoriety Points going towards their “contract”(this being the contract you make when creating a character) which is dropped when the player dies and retrieved in the same way Blood Echoes were.Hunters would be using Blood Healing still but a safer, more refined version. This new version of Blood Healing comes from individual hunters using their own blood placed into vials and infused with medication to achieve the same level of blood healing as before. Hunters would still have to buy more vials/find them when running low.What’s the different between the Hunters’ Guild and the Hunters’ Dream?The Hunters’ Dream and the Hunters’ Guild are two separate areas, one focusing on the physical “wakening” working and the other the corporeal. The Hunters’ Dream acts differently in Bloodborne 2 in that the player must be killed by a boss in order to be taken to the dream, the player need not go there unless to memorize runes, spend insight, or PvP other players in the graveyard. After the first initial death to a boss the player may go to the dream freely from a lamp. The Hunters’ Guild is where the player levels up, upgrades weapons, purchases equipment and items, and stores equipment and items. When interacting with a lamp the player has the choice of going to the Dream or to a lamp found outside the guild.Another interesting addition to I thought of is active co-op. Instead of having to set your summon sign down or set a password for a specific player(which would still be available options) the player may sign their name to another hunter’s contract. How this differs is that if a player chooses to do this they may only play co-op with that specific player without having to summon. Both would simply share a save file, equipment, and Notoriety Points. They may play without that player on that same save file but the difficulty scaling would be set as if there were two players(monsters have more health, do more damage). This would only be doable before defeating the first boss and not after. <|endoftext|><|title|>The Metropolitan Police: An Open World Game Where You Can Develop Your Career As A Police Officer in London.You start as a newly recruited police officer.

Said titans also vary by terrain type: Land, Sea, Air, and Space.Titans are crewed by a commander who designates targets and drives the Titan, and 4 crew who man the Titan's weaponry by quadrant but can overlap fire depending on weapon systems and Titan Design.Designated targets provide bonus points to the crew when hit, all crew and commanders have customizable passive/active buffs but only the commander's buffs effect the entire crew.Game types are the usual capture the point or TDM, where teams can be 1 Titan each with up to 12 Titans or 6v6 Titans on a team. Crew can vote to mutiny to swap one of themselves with the commander (3 votes takes the seat), in exchange for a timed debuff. Commanders and crew vote on a Titan type in the start of the match in a 2 round scheme where the first eliminates all but 5 Titans.Games force all Titans onto the same terrain (no airships v non-flying turtles) but are unbound by style, so a Star Destroyer in a broadside battle with a flying castle while Ornithopters bomb both before returning to their steam powered airship carrier is allowed.I realize it's a mess but I've only been thinking it over for like an hour and have 0 artistic or game dev skill.<|endoftext|><|title|>A free 3 way elimination fighting game which takes place in the future, 3 semi large robots named titans (not related to titanfall) fight in a medium sized arena against each otherThis has been in my mind for a while and its seems like it would work as an actual game. The game would take place in the year 2145, after a war on earth ravaged the world and left it in ruins, forcing colonization to on mars. After its terraforming, earth was is now a wasteland where people just run blood sports and what not. In one of these blood sports would be one named annihilation. The game would focus on being the last if the three alive by the end of a round. To win the whole match you must win two rounds. However players dont simply have health... they have armor covering there bodies and to take an opponent out, you must deal as much damage as possible during a fight. Once enough has been dealt, they will lose both armor and body parts. Once a players is on like one arm left, crawling to attack they can be finished with some kind  of animation which will give you extra health to finish off the other person. If a player loses all there armor, they can take enough damage to the head and die.There are Five playable titans in the game with unique abilities, as the game progresses there will be more titans and maps to play.𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘴-BLUE MOONThe icon of the game, this guy used to be a construction unit until the war, where the construction units were reprogrammed to be fighters due to the weight they can carry and take.

(Not a puzzle game.)This may have been done before but simpler, but here's the idea. You have a (3D) area where you can place items down. There are four different types of items, and many different tiers. The three types are mines, conveyors, upgraders, and furnaces. Mines drop ores at different rates, of different sizes, and different values. Conveyors transport these ores with different speeds, levels of stability, and directions. Upgraders are parts that ores can go through and they increase the value. There are three types of upgraders, money adders, money multipliers, and special effecters. They do what they say. Furnaces are the final destination of ores. They convert the ores into money at different rates. A very weak furnace would process ores at half value, while a very strong one would process them at 50x their value. You buy these parts with said money. Better parts require more money, and research. (Will get into research later.)  Like every other tycoon game, this game has a prestige system. Once you reach a high enough amount of money, you can reset. Possibly around the quadrillions. Once you prestige, you lose all the items you bought with money and get back your starter items, but you have one new item. This item is a high level prestige item, and it is better than most shop items. An example would be a prestige item that triples the ore value, but can be used only once. Prestige prices would go up semi-linearly to keep the game balanced. As you prestige more, the pool of items that can be drawn will increase in size. The new items will be better and/or have more creative effects.&amp;#x200B;Research is important early on. Research unlocks different and better shop items you can place down. You gain research by putting ores in furnaces at different rates.&amp;#x200B;Extra Notes: This is an incremental game, not an idle game. You have to semi-actively play to progress.&amp;#x200B;TL;DR: 3D Sandbox tycoon game with many items about automation and getting so much money you would need scientific notation to write it.<|endoftext|><|title|>A Game Where You Play Other GamesThis is more a game about games.  I'd love to see a meta ladder.  Matchmake for me. Find someone near my level.  Then, through a series of choices of the type of game to play, we play one of the many, many games out there.  This game utilizes a library which allows the game to create a specific set of circumstances for the two players to play versus each other.  The winner goes up in rank, like a typical mmr ladder.  The biggest issues are getting the game makers to use your library and finding games both players own.  The second issue is solved by the new game streaming services.  Mitigation for the first issue is that you look for games that already allow you to call the game from the command line.  I'm positive there are some out there. I don't know which ones  For single player games, you don't need a direct competition.  Use Super Mario Bros. for example.  The software loads each player into World 2-3.

Ten minutes ago I looked for a sub Reddit that I could post this idea. At work when its slow I write these ideas down on a sketch pad; hope you guys enjoy, mind the horrible grammar and spelling. Hopefully its can be used to spark some great ideas from you guys and can help you thing of some awesome ideas.So here's the Game; a game where  you are viewing from the eyes of the main character that is living with terrible insomnia. Experiencing each day while living with it, while off any form of medication, for around 8 days. As someone who suffers from insomnia I have experienced multiple days without sleep, not to the extent of the game but roughly four days or so days; some experiences in the early game is what I have personally experienced.[ 8 days being the length of the game, every day you play through unlocks that level so you can go back and play the game from that point, this is so you don't have to sit through the first three or so days every time you want to play]* Setting= The characters house and a city, haven't put much thought into what city it should be based off of, could be completely unique, just a typical city environment.  * mechanics= one of those games where you can't really do much other than experience what is going on in the world, Music helps shape the world as you see it, the longer you play through it, the more warped the game gets and the more visually pleasing and horrifying the setting of the "world" becomes* When ever I am having an episode, music seems to make things better; but I have had it turn on me and make things change, not terribly but it makes my imagination warp what I see, which is where this idea comes from.**These are just level designs i though up of and I'm going to post them because if gives a better view of how I thought the game could play through, take all this with a grain of salt or just ignore**Day 1-3 are slow, these days will go by much faster than the other ones* Day 1: focus's on setting up story, you wake up from sleeping in the morning and basically it fast forward throughout the day. Showing the player the character's everyday routine. You Start to play the character right before he goes to bed, only it seems he's out of sleep medicine, its going to be a sleepless night. This will set up controls and mechanics of the game (big mechanic [only one i really thought of] is the phone and music.)     *  Music will play a really big role in this game later on towards the later days    * Day 2 starts up after the sun rises from day one; the only thing you gain from this day is that you find out he made a phone call to get more medicine. Game Resumes with day fast forwarded to night time. This time you start hear the noises of the house, (they become more prevalent throughout the game) nights become a little spooky and the main character is noticeably at unease about the noises he hears, constantly raising his head to check around his room.* Day three: find out that the doctor has to reschedule your appointment to next week; fast forward to the night time (some visuals on the average day going by very fast but the player can visibly see how the days are getting harder for the character to function, player is starting to get paranoid) Third night you start to become more paranoid, the sounds of the house are becoming louder, as if someone is in the house with you. You don't visibly see anything as the player but music will sound as if you are about to catch someone (typical horror music) * Day 4-6 starts to get into the main mechanic of the game and you get to experience, the music. You make a phone call once again to the doctor. This time you are very angry; doctor tells you to check the mail he sent some experimental drugs that might help with the sleeping problem. He also suggest him calm down and listen to some music, shower, get something to drink/eat; take care of everything you possible can. Before you leave you check the mail and there is medicine there, without reading the bottle you take one in hopes it will make you tired throughout the day (you can clearly see on bottle it says dont take and be in sunlight) .You take his advice, fast forwards to the train station (he takes on into the city where he works).     * You as the player are sitting down on the train, and remember the doctor said to play some music to calm you down, so you do. Now as the player you have a selection of different genre's of music to choice from, each one will affect the game so try and play through it with a bunch of different genre's each play through. The Music will start to affect the surroundings. * Each day getting more and more visually enjoyable to the player, depending on the genre of music it will be differ per selection. Each day you end up play a little more of the walk to work, day 4 is stops once the train stops; day 5 is to the doorstep at work walking a block or two in the city, and day 6 is right into the office; going up an elevator and walking hallways and what not (day 6 having the most visual affects to the outside world and game) At night the pills seem to have no effect, you just lay in bed with headphones on, nothing happens at night day 4-6 [at this point i'm not really sure what could happen, haven't through it that far through, maybe some cool things with night time stars and music making the night sky look trippy and what not]* Day 7 is the last day of medication that you got in the mail, and the last day before your appointment. As the sun rises, you roll over in your bed knowing you have to start your day; as you roll over in the corning of your eye you see something it was fast but you are positive you saw something.     * for anyone who doesn't know after 6/7 days without sleep you can start to hallucinate.* welcome to the last like visually aesthetic level of the game, also you cannot choice the music you play today; it will automatically choice for you. Personally i'd like to think it be anything by [Paper Chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4cLlTtpLI4) because their music is exposed to be creepy and will make the walk go by fairly slow and very 2spooky5you, but that is unlikely the case due to legal issues and what not. The whole way this level is set up is to apply the music aspect of the game and the newly discovered hallucinations, you can visibly see more paranoia from the character, constantly checking over your shoulder, while having the world almost crumble beneath you (kinda like how the world in inception started to warp) while seeing these horrid creatures stair at you/ come at you.  You ask for a ride home from work from a co-worker, car ride home you look see these beings from the window.Night time for this will turn into a horror-esk game. As you lay down the phone you usually use throughout the day is dead, needs to be charged; can't find your headphones due to how hard it is to navigate the home with the hallucinations. Night time the goal is to get your headphones and make it back to your bed (you can use a phone while its charging) As you maneuver the house you have to experience the world around you start to warp and deteriorate, while having eyes on the wall watch you, things watching you at every corner, things chase you (or seem like they are). It should take around like 20~30 minutes to get through this level or something like that, not sure how long vr games should be, hopefully that is long enough.* Day 8 is you getting a phone call from the doctor, you beg and plead he makes a house call, he agrees and will take some time to get there, luckily you as a player only wait like 2 minutes due to the lack of time perception (which is a thing that happens with me, idk if that is the professional name for it) you also called out of work. You finally get the medication, and this time its a higher prescription because of the lack of sleep you have had, luckily you don't have work the following day. Right before the game ends you take a look in the mirror before you take the pills, besides the fact you looks terrible, you can see the monsters in the back of the mirrors, the character is making direct eye contact through the mirror, you take the pill and head off towards the room. This is meant to be kinda the relief of the game, knowing at the end you are no longer phased by the night you had before you are taking your meds. this takes you to the credits yada yada yada, now you get to select what you get to play by the day, this is so you can experience the days 4-6 again with different genre's of music, each day having different visuals with each genre. Hope you guys like the idea, I thought it was kinda neat as a VR game; sorry again about the spelling and grammar ill try to clean it up as best as possible, not the best of writers. and sorry its so long. <|endoftext|><|title|>Reverse levelingHow about a game where the progression is reversed where you start fully leveled up and as you “level” you are forced to pick one of your skills to get rid of.

When you shoot, the 3 of them shoot at the same time and the "global" energy is reduced    * On the same location of two different floors there might be two different items, one good and one bad, like a life leach on one floor and an energy boost on the other. So at given moments you may have to make a choice whether you sacrifice some of your life points by stepping on a life leach item to be able to get some energy by stepping on a energy boost item with the hero on the other floor, or viceversa (get life and sacrifice some energy)    * there are civilians on the floors as well, and in the location where there's an enemy on one floor there might be a civilian on another floor. So when you shoot at the enemy on one floor, you might kill the civilian getting penalized in return in some way, losing points or whatever.[video!](https://reddit-uploaded-video.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/t2_5eh35em%2Fehmnhdsldwx01)<|endoftext|><|title|>MONKEY GAMEAn open world, third person game.

You doze off in a calm, serene, sea. You wake up to a thunderclap and rain pouring down on the newly reformed sea, waves crash on the deck as the boat's power goes out, the only light you see is from the clash of the lightning. You traverse to the back of your boat to find the emergency power, and wade through the knee-deep water inside of the cabin, to find that.Your not alone.A figure with dangly arms and legs sees you, eyes glowing, scuffling towards you with great speed, the lighting blinds you and you look back to find--nothing there--you shake it off and keep trying to find your power source.Along the way, you find a broken family photo, a baseball glove, and a child's shirt.Mechanics:Lighting strikes, monster spawns.Hide until the lightning strikes, monster will disappearKeep going until you find the emergency powerYou find the power, only for it to not work, but instead the ship capsizes, and you get knocked out by indoor debris.Chapter 2, "Listen"Waking up, not concussed in the slightest, which confuses you, you take hold of your current surroundings, you are on the bottom floor of the boat.Your sight is faltered, a strong mist surrounds you and your boat, again, rocking calmly in the waves. You can't see further then a couple of feet, maybe less. You walk around, arms extended, trying to find your way to another light source and find one of those flashlights you have to shake to gain energy. You find your way around, and hear a blood curdling roar in the distance, and soon, scuttling and shuffling around you, you slowly move to the top of the boat, to gain a bearing of your current surroundings.Along the way, you find a broken door lock, a beer bottle and a bloody glass shardMechanics: shake the FL (flashlight) to get battery, which depletes over time, and makes noise. Hide and charge the FL to not attract the monster. Slowly make your way to the top of the boat. Make sure to You get to the top of the boat, to find you are anchored, you slowly bring the anchor back up but you are attacked by the monster, you run and fall into the water, the boat slowly moving away from you. You swim towards the boat, the monster looking down at you.Chapter 3, "Recluse"You use all your might and swim towards the boat, using your final breath you finally reach it, holding onto the slightly extended anchor for dear life.You get to the top of the deck to find the monster, sitting down, not noticing your presence. It holds a hat--yours. It looks back to you, and walks towards you, you run away, distinctly.

Action. SienceFiction. Third Person.Im sorry for bad english(not my motherlanguage)I was thinking about this concept, So to make a game interesting something needs to be done witch has never been done before and after the coronacrisis a game with plenty of humor couldn't be too wrong. But the action cannot be missed as well.Story needs good humor witch is kind of a mental reliefe at the same time. Perhaps putting in references to recent internet memes/jokes/fun.So here we go:3d person like DS, GTA, TES... etc.You are a funny looking alien dude on a Spaceship not knowing where to go, fuel is almost epty. So u take course to the next planet witch is Earth of course. You hit atmosphere and u get attacked immedeatly by whatever(there is plenty of room for ideas). So they bring you to a military base(like area 51) ...  and lock you up... time passes when the event takes place where crazy people storm the base and someone frees you.Map: To make the map unique i thought of another funfactor, witch could be very cool at the same time: Since conspiracydudes say flat earth and reptilians etc. we could add exactly that to the map. So we add a otherside below who also has the oposite polarity, everything upside down basicly. There will be another city with inhabitants... demons, evil looking beings whatever....Between the two different worlds there will be the core. Everything connected with dungeons. But the player will find out about that step by step, first he will not know about the otherside and the dungeons. In late campain there will be also the possibility to fly with spaceship on the outside around. Witch will be difficould, cuz both sides build Spacestations on the surrounding space after they optain the technology of the protagonists Spaceship. So basicly the game escalates from small fights to a big war and the end.The Person who saves you brings you to a farm or a native village ...whatever. After some quests you will be able to go to the city. You slowly learn the language witch gives funny scenes. In the city you will get introduced to the strange lifestyle of humanity. Of course the city will be filled up with the craziest people from everywhere. The city will have districts where the different races live with their different cultural lifestyle. A downtown in the center and outside of the city there is farming and woods and stuff. All the districts will contain unique stuff to unlock. Tatoos, Weapons, Techniques, Clothes. I think characterdesign is very important. I also thought being the aliendude could be annoying with time, so you will die in the first half, and become a human of your chosen race. Of course the dead has to be dramatic as hell. The aliencharacter could realise he is accepted by society(at least his friends) but he cant interact with the humans as he would like to. He also has enemies who are necessary for fights in the game and hate him for being an alien. So he has that wish to be a human and he alwas keeps looking for ways... till it happens in a unexpected moment that he dies or gets killed. Maybe the death could take place at the core of the planet. He could be responsible for the underworld creechers obtaining his technology so basicly missions on both sides before death.When it comes to vehicles i have a different idea. No cars, but faster movement, higher jumps, and special abilities will be normal on this game for some characters and the player will be aware of their existence during the game. But spaceships in late game could be nice if you combine graphics with sound in a good way.Music: As soon as the player hits the city he will get headphones, who will give the player the abilty to connect to radiostations while running and jumping.Weapons: thought of extraordinary powerfull melee and perhaps some guns(too many games have those already in my opinion) and barehanded punching/kicking martial arts variations who can be learned by the different Cultures.PowerUp/Lvl Up. Skilthree, skills can be unlocked with points whith the player recieves by leveling up. Unlock skillthrees. Certain skillthrees could be unlocked at the different tattooshops by making quests for the different cultures, as weapons and their upgrades. Just an idea.If this sounds interesting i can make a more complex concept, a have enough time with quarantine and if already got more specific ideas for quests.... if you would add or change something, comment.Thanks for reading!<|endoftext|><|title|>A VR game in which you are a tiny alien piloting a human from inside his head, going about your days trying not to get found out that you aren't human.The cockpit is like the panoramic ones in Titanfall, and you control your "human" with a bunch of retro-style levers, pulleys and switches.

You're a skater and can do fancy figure-skating type spin moves as a way to fight (mostly involving slicing people with your skates).  Also you can build up momentum by skating fast and then jump attacking. The controls would be Tony Hawk-ish, so that building momentum and actually landing attacks would take some real skill.  Falling down would be bad, it would give the enemies free hits on you and reset your momentum.This kind of game would be very animation and kinematic heavy, so well beyond my reach.*for the record, my wife chose which sport<|endoftext|><|title|>Game idea: lovecraftian lore based exploration gameJust random thoughts.Game inspired by sunless sea and interactive books, where a world is generated and you go explore to find new stories. The objective is to survive as long as possible while finding new mysteries.The graphics could be top view very stylized, would be cool to have a generated world like dwarf fortress, you explore new locations to find weird stories with multiple choices (like sunless sea).Of course you might die while following a quest/story but if you are successful you can find some secrets or artifact that will help you onward.Every story should have a tag, so for example a sea based story/quest can only start near a seaside locations (a fisherman hut or a cave)I have always been interested in the idea of expanding content so it would be cool to have the possibility for the community for the community to submit new stories that can be included in the world coherently using the tag system.Combat can be text based for symplicity and there would be no real main objective just the thrill to find new stories and weird characters .<|endoftext|>
