1,"Every time i come with some great game idea at first it seems amazing, but as i work on it, it becomes more and more “nothing special”.Do you developers have the same problem?

2,"A game where you are a ghost in a cemetery that can enter the graves of dead people and change their past. 
When walking through the cemetery you could read the graves and the causes of death, or see family members murmuring (in text or voices) some regret about their loved ones giving a clue of how they died and that they could have avoided it. The ghost could ""enter"" the graves and enter a level that represents the exact moment of that person's death, and the player could choose to take an action to save or not save that person, and if they do so when they return to the graveyard, the grave disappears.To make it more interesting, you could make a limit of trips for the ghost since each time it exhausts its own vital energy, and it could also make a connection between the lives of people, in such a way that if one is saved this is change the future for others. The end could be that the character is saved through a certain combination of people whose futures were changed. And make this one have no memories of his death.

3,"A survival game but instead of being in the wilderness or post-apocalypse, you're a homeless person in a contemporary Urban city.

4,"An RPG where standard rpg rules are actually laws, and breaking them attracts police 
So for instance, instead of simply being restricted to four members in your party, you can have up to four, but can also break the law by adding more; however, this would attract powerful police enemies. &#x200B;I also thought that it would be cool if certain parts of the game encouraged you to just *lightly* bend the law; for instance, when saving a prisoner from, like, a tower or something, they'd have to join your party, meaning you'd either have to break the law to take them with you, or leave a party member behind forever
 
"
5,"Had this idea years ago, before I joined reddit. 
You start at a character creation screen, where you're given all these awesome options for traits, some of them chosen at random, and almost enough points to max out some stats.After making the final touches and saving, you're taken to another creation screen with less options, and about half the amount of points to go into stats.You are informed that the character you previously made is the antagonist, and you may have to face them later.

6,"There should be a horror game where you go into an abandoned military base and for the first half, the monsters torment you and you are powerless and just run, barely staying alive. Then you reach the center of the base where there's a massive cache of insane weapons and then...then it's your turn. 
 Basically, first half Outlast. Second half Doom.

8,"A sandbox game with completely foreign physics. Objects get lighter when wet. An object's momentum is dependent on how hot it is. Gravity is object-dependent rather than world-dependent. Nothing makes sense... and yet with player experimentation it can. 
This is a game about exploration. But instead of exploring a world or its history like Breath of the Wild or Outer Wilds, the thing you are exploring is new physics itself. The game world behaves unlike anything we're used to... and it's all unnamed, uncategorized, undocumented and unestablished.The promise is that the player could get the feeling Isaac Newton had when he realized the actual nature of gravity.

BTW: not a developer or anything just thought of this idea and wanted to put it out thereEdit: Since I have posted this Among us has blown up, my idea is similar except single player with maybe some sort of story line, and “tasks” would be what your host did before you took control of their body and you figure out from context clues what you’re supposed to do

11,"I trained an AI to make new game ideas based on all of the posts in r/gameideas 
Try it out here: [aideas.oscerlot.com](https://aideas.oscerlot.com)It's still learning, but it's been trained on the 15,000 or so posts from this subreddit!Enter a starting prompt, hit generate (might take a minute or so) and watch it attempt to construct game elements following on from your prompt. Whatever it comes out with, you have nothing to blame but yourselves.It can still get stuck sometimes or generate nonsensical answers, so just try again or maybe try a different or longer prompt.&#x200B;Example:  **A game where you play as John Wick trying to get revenge for his dog's death.** It would be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you thought he streets of New York, including the city's iconic buildings, along with your favorite thugs and street scum. It would also be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you on underground vigilantes in different cities around the city.   You can pick your method of killing. Using firearms or knives, body armor, or body parts, or stealing bodies from hospitals and hiding then, or even using the phone app of the game to call a tip or text someone who number strangers who have either high or low status.   If you die, you start all over again. Maybe you get a call from a local police department and the person in front of you decides to go out to the crime scene. Maybe your number is called back but you go out alone. You start meeting trouble after getting called to the police, and even get a call home from a distance police officer who seems to know who killed your family.   I want you to feel responsible for your family. I want you to feel your pain and sorrow. I want you to feel safe. I want to feel protected.

12,"Driving simulator where you actually have to follow traffic rules. And then it gets weird. 
The most intuitive way to track player's performance would be using a score system, but I wouldn't make it too obvious: make bad performances being followed by angry comments by other drivers and chasing cops or something.But then, imagine the game being set in a city where every morning the mayor changes some traffic rules, and you have to read and remember today's rule to be a good driver. Absolutely absurd laws like today is legal to hit other cars and run over pedestrian but not turning right.It would soon make interesting and hilarious gameplay.
 
"
13,"A horror game that purposefully drops the framerate when the monster shows up, but the monster itself renders at full speed. 
The game's engine is made to always render at a smooth 60fps, but at times it will repeat frames to simulate slowdown and frame stuttering. This is done to make the player think the game is optimized poorly. It's made to look like the game's spooky rendering effects, which kick in when the player's character is ""scared"", are too much for the engine to handle.However the framerate *really* tanks when the monster shows up, even if he's not on-screen. And when the monster appears in front of you, no matter how low the framerate dropped, the monster comes at you at full rendering speed. It's almost like he doesn't belong in the game.

15,"“The Guy In The Chair” - a game where you play as the hero’s “guy in the chair”, bringing up information, schematics, coordinates, hack security systems, disable power grids, etc on the fly as your heroic counterpart fights the big bad. 
You work for a sort of superhero call-center that provides as-needed support to the various super heroes of the world. As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.For the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). For the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.For the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.The interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.You would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.There would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.All from the comfort of your chair.

17,"Dating sim, but you've already won the girl. Now you're married, planning a family, and you have to keep her - i.e. avoid losing the spark and divorcing. 
I don't really have paragraphs to add about this like I usually do; this is a game I legitimately have no interest in making myself, but I have a strong suspicion that there are people who would enjoy the challenge. Heck, there's probably people on this sub that have been through something similar and can base some of the game on real life.
 
"
18,"A horror game where you aren't the victims 
The idea I had was a game where a monster of some kind is hunting and killing the main characters except it doesn't care about you as the player. For example imagine a sci-fi horror about an alien hunting the crew of a spaceship except instead of being a crew member you are a generic matinence robot and have to work to save them.

19,"A horror game set in the old west where you play as a woman accused of being a witch 
The game would start out with you escaping your holding cell. You'd proceed into the Rocky Mountains while being tracked by men with bolt/lever action rifles. As night falls during your escape, weird and spooky things could be in the forest that slowly reveal that you are indeed a witch which is something the player character did not know and/or refuses to believe.

20,"A God sim where you have to prevent the humans from discovering they are just part of a simulation in your computer. 
This idea was inspired by the recent Elon Musk interview at E3 2019 (find it on Youtube). &#x200B;A 'God' sim where you have to prevent the human inhabitants figuring out they are just part of a simulation.  Out of your control,  the humans develop more and more advanced technologies over time.  From fire, metal refining, electricity, space travel, quantum physics, etc.  Like to begin with the stars and planets are just a sky-box, and the game is, you have to add real planets before they develop telescopes etc.  Like laying road just before the run over it.  If they figure out they're just a simulation in your computer, then its game over.&#x200B;New Game +.  When you complete the game, you as 'God' of the simulation discover that you yourself are just part of an even bigger simulation.  Now you must prevent the other 'God' players around you from realising they themselves are part of the bigger simulation.

21,"RPG that instead of having a huge open worlda map, you have a small space but you can move through time. 
So actually an ""Open Time"" RPG where instead of having a huge map/world, you have a smaller space that you cannot leave, could be as small as a room or a building, or a space ship, or a small city like rapture. Then you can move freely back and forth in time and your actions would affect how the place involves in time. There would also be other time travelers who based on your actions might also affect the timeline so the past might also change without you knowing.

22,"This Sub Should be Better 
This is a great subreddit. I doubt I have any more saved posts than ones that come from here. Several of the ideas I’ve found here became some of my first game prototypes and I’m grateful to have found this community and explore the sharing of game ideas.That said, there is a constant plague of terrible posts to this subreddit that stems from the same issue: they aren’t thought out.We’ve seen posts that say:- Should be like ‘insertgamehere’...” then ask for carbon copies of that game- Posts that have no actual way to be made into a game without a time machine- One sentence posts that give no information- Posts that are too poorly-worded to understandThe best posts on this subreddit are formatted with subheadings. They will include headers like: STORY, GAMEPLAY, VISUALS and speak a little on each element. I wouldn’t mind if each idea had to have at least these three basic parts thought out before getting posted here.Look, I get it. This is people sharing ideas freely and that means some will be bad. Some of the best ideas here have been one sentence long. But it’s easy to see that a large portion of those terrible ideas could be chafed out by requiring a bare minimum of thought entered into the idea. I WANT to make a person’s idea. I don’t want to read the twentieth post asking for “Call of Duty but with fully collapsible environment, VR compatibility, and nothing else.”Tell me I’m screaming at clouds, I don’t care. I’ll still love this sub tomorrow and my next game will probably come from here. This is just my thoughts and I want to know what others think.

27,"A 2D fantasy game in which you cook and invent new recipes for your town restaurant during the evening, but every morning you forage and hunt for exciting new ingredients in the wildlands. 
Imagine *Moonlighter* but instead of running a shop you run a restaurant, and instead of dungeon crawling you explore a procedurally generated open wilderness teeming with unique plants, animals and monsters.The game focuses on inventing/discovering new recipes. It's not just about what ingredients you combine for a dish, but also about how you prepare or cook each of the ingredients that make the dish unique. It's like if *Breath of the Wild* and *Overcooked* had a top-down 2D baby. Customers request a type of dish (a stew, a roast, a desert, etc.) or type of ingredient (wild game, tree nuts, etc.) and you're allowed to do whatever you want with it. The more intricate the dish, the more you are rewarded. You also slowly discover what ingredients pair well and which don't as you experiment with dishes.On the adventure side you find a vast wilderness with a few set biomes. Early on the hero is limited by the starting inventory capacity, few specialized tools and weaker weapons, along with the player's unfamiliarity and novice skills. As you buy upgrades using the restaurant profits and learn how the wilderness works, you're able to travel further, forage deeper and slay the most dangerous wildlife. Since the world is procedural, you can plant seeds to harvest later. Those plants can attract certain wildlife to hunt later too.

30,"A game where the day restarts over and over again (like Groundhog Day) but you play as a different character every time. 
Let’s say there are about 20 - 30 characters and everyday after 12pm or if you die you restart the day and you are somebody else. From an office worker to a random high school student to the mayor to a hobo on the street. Your goal is pretty simple, solve a murder (or another mystery, maybe find out why this Groundhog Day thing is happening?) in a small town. You can interact with the other characters in dialogue and find clues as to what’s happening. You will have a journal that will transfer between characters but any other items will be gone. Certain characters have certain benefits and disadvantages like the mayor has access to more information or areas but he has more work to do before you can actually do stuff with him. When you play as the homeless guy you can move and do things the entire day but of course you start the day broke and with nothing.If I were to make it, it would be in a pixel art top down view.

31,"Dreamt of playing this game, I want it to be real so much it hurts. 
I had a dream of playing this game last night and I cannot get it out of my head. You start out as an evil all powerful overlord who decides to leave the life of darkness and become good. Now, the mechanics of a normal game where you get stronger as you progress were flipped. You start out all powerful and crushing enemies with big strong attacks, however, your character draws their power from evil and darkness. So the further they stray from evil the weaker the hero gets. I basically started out crushing enemies easily but, over time, I'd lose height, strength, and armor. Slowly becoming a normal man and having to use quick, evasive, clever tactics to take down these giant beasts I once rivaled. In the end you start to draw power from light and and morality and use it to take down evil for good.There wasn't much storyline other than that but in the dream the game mechanics were so much fun, starting out as a huge powerful behemoth, then having to adapt and switch up your play style as you progressed. I woke up like, I need to play some more, only to realize it was a dream 😫I know it may seem vague or silly, but it was a dream so don't be too harsh 🤷Edit: I wanted to do a quick edit to clear some things up. First, I never really took this idea seriously. It was just a cool dream I had and wanted to share it with more people other than my boyfriend (I'm a girl btw, don't care about being called 'he' honestly, but I figured I'd throw that out there in case you cared about pronouns) I looked for a subreddit for video game ideas and posted it. Maybe it would inspire someone, maybe not. Had no further intentions than that if I'm being honest.Second, maybe I worded things poorly. The fighting system I had in mind isn't necessarily a reverse progression, nor do you get 'weaker'. Perhaps I threw that word around too willy-nilly. Just in general your character progressively turns into a normal man, instead of a huge demon monster. Thus the fighting style changes. I imagined something similar to the first GoW fighting style where you would press a sequence of buttons at the right time to do scenematic type attacks, to some of the mid bosses, harder enemies etc.. Ex: jumping on an enemie's hand at the right moment, running up his arm, and some neck stabbin'. The further you progress the more you get punished for your mess ups, mis-clicks, and failed dodges etc, considering your armor and such is gone. So in that sense, yes weaker here would work.Third, you would gain more abilities and speed. Higher jumps, some protective light, the less evil your character gets you do get bonuses. There is a reward system. It's not all punishment. But, as has been pointed out, the game just gets harder as you advance, like games do. That's how games work. I understand that. The uniqueness about this idea was the way it happens, and the battle mechanics changing, forcing you to adapt to it or die. If that's something people wouldn't actually like, so be it. I thought it was cool.Fourth, I'm going to say it again for those in the back that didn't hear me. This was all based on a freaking dream. I just played a cool game in a dream and I couldn't get it out of my head, so I shared. Thanks for the feedback and ideas though, some of them were actually pretty dope and made the idea better. I still don't plan on anything coming from it, but that's okay. Have a great day! Happy holidays!

32,"A post-apocalyptic game where all your information is from before the apocalypse 
So for instance your map of a city would be for the city as it was before the apocalypse, meaning you can't rely on it completely while exploring. I just thought this was a cool idea IDK
 
"
33,"The opposite of a stealth game. Instead of playing as the stealthy predator, you control the guards (RTS-style) as they search for and defend against the hiding predator. 
You control an expendable squad of hunters as they enter elaborate, open-ended rooms designed for a stealth game, except in this game you are on the receiving end. The view is top-down and controls a lot like an RTS game in that you give your squad orders and they execute them. *Fog of war* occludes anything that isn't within the line of sight of your squad, so the enemy can sneak up on your hunters if you aren't careful.A lot of the gameplay is about looking for environmental clues (broken ventilation grates, trails of blood, etc.) to track the enemy. Then you either sweep the area and funnel the enemy into a corner that will leave them no choice but to pounce. The enemy AI will also target your most vulnerable team members, so you can go the risky route and lure the enemy by leaving one or two of your guys alone.Your squad members have their own individual heart rates, and if they're too rattled by losing sight of the enemy or seeing their squadmates fall to the predator, they will begin to panic, drop stats and disobey orders. You can calm them back down by putting a squadmate near them, in which case one will calm down at the expense of making the other a little more scared.****I was thinking about what kind of story/setting/premise could benefit from this gameplay in which you're basically hunting Batman from the Arkham games. This is the premise:You belong to an agency that hunts vampires, and it recently found a sprawling gothic castle in which a number of high-value vampires reside. In order to organize a massive assault on the castle, the agency began hiring mercenaries for the operation. Now you must clear this castle room by room, all the while finding upgrades, adding new recruits and promoting your most valuable mercenaries. The further you enter the castle, the more powerful the vampires that stalk you.

Shot someone in the head? Their controls are now back to front until they can push their brain back into their skull.Shot them in the eye? They're now blind until they can find their eyeballs or anyone else for that matter, and slot them back into their eye sockets.Shot someone's arm off? Looks like they won't be able to carry or use any weapons or items. At least they can still move about and maybe dropkick you.Shoot a guy in the leg and watch him fall over. Shoot him in the other leg and see him struggle to get up again.You only win when your opponent has given up.

35,"Your health bar is your sword 
Just a silly idea for a game where you battle with your actual health bars. I envision this as a top-down twin-stick battler where you swing your health bar around to damage enemies. When you are damaged, your health bar shortens, which reduces your reach.This would be a pretty simple gimmicky idea, which could even work as a mechanic or specific weapon in a roguelite-type game.

37,"A game where you can take your eye out and throw it. Wherever it goes, that's where the game camera goes. 
You play as a Mike Wazowski-type creature with a giant eye, which can be removed and thrown. The eye is still attached to the optic nerve, of course, so it eventually springs back into the eye socket. But when it is away from the player, the camera follows.   This could lead to some interesting puzzles involving camera perspective. Say you encounter two pathways, one with an incredibly strong enemy who can instantly kill you in one shot, and one with a treasure chest. You need to use your removable eye to determine the safest path. You could also find a way to trap the eye in a certain area while the player goes and does something else. You need to be careful though, because the eye can be separated from the optic nerve if it is hit, in which case you need to wander around in the dark to recover it. Once recovered, you can see normally. Maybe you even collect eyes to get better/clearer vision.   You can also you use the optic eye for as a grappling hook for platforming, maybe by swinging it on a certain type of branch.

38,"A shooter where you play both sides 
So I had this campaign idea where you play as two characters. The twist is, however, that the two characters are fighting on opposite sides of the war without the player knowing. The story makes it seem that both characters are on the same side, as they both recieve the same propaganda and reasons for fighting. The player doesn't  realize that the characters are on opposite sides until the very end where one character goes on a sniper mission and kills a target. After the target is shot, it switches to the other character on a walk in the woods, where suddenly his best friend is killed by sniper fire. The player is supposed to then realized that he was the one who fired the shot. The goal of the game is to show the real effects that war has, and that both sides can be convinced that their cause is right.

You were able to pinpoint their location to this corporate office building, so you infiltrated by pretending to work here as ""the new guy"" and now everyone is giving you random tasks thinking you work in their department.You are certain one of these humans is your beloved alien partner (much more experienced at acting human).

41,"A visual novel that gradually gets more disturbing depending on how late at night/early in the morning you play it. 
This would have to be based on your time zones (sort of like Mystic Messenger I believe). Basically, it's a visual novel/horror game that would sort of break the fourth wall, much like *Doki Doki Literature Club.* The setting of the game is an average Japanese high school with adorable anime girls that you can bond with. At the end of the day, the girl you interacted most with that day will give you real-life advice, normally something simple, like ""Remember to stay hydrated!"" or ""If you're having trouble finding friends, just put yourself out there!"" After giving this advice, you can explore the school, go to clubs, or go straight home to work on homework for five minutes real-time until the sleeping cutscene (six seconds real-time).However, the first time you play through a day at school, the girl you interacted with will tell you: ""You best not stay up too late. You don't want to know what happens when you stay up too late."" The times for ""normal"" gameplay would be 7:30 A.M to around 11:30 P.M. The game is still playable for the half hour between 11:30 and midnight, but slightly more unsettling, with the days taking longer and the girls taking on slightly glitched appearances, with sometimes distorted text, and advice also being distorted (instead of ""Remember to stay hydrated,"" it would be ""Remember to d̶͈͝š̵̡f̷̘͛ģ̶̓t̶͎̃ǹ̴͉ỳ̵̧s̸̩̅b̵͙̚f̶̗̃ḁ̸͒y̷̰͝ū̷̩d̴͔̋h̸̠͂f̴͉̓v̸̟̈ĝ̴̘ý̷̫ẃ̶̙f̴͇͗u̵̟͒s̷̟̈ȗ̴̬e̴̬̕k̴̰̾h̴͚̄ŕ̶̡g̶͉̋"") At midnight, it goes to full-on horror game, and even if you're at home or in the sleep cutscene, the MC will be sent to the lobby of the school. Text will flash on the screen that says ""I told you not to stay up late."" Your goal is now to survive the school (filled with students taking on forms of indescribable horror, the main girls being the fastest and most powerful) until normal gameplay hours resume, or you can simply choose to save your progress, close out the game and go to bed.If you choose to continue with a save file made during horror hours, then where you pick up depends on when you resume playing. If you continue with that save file during normal hours, then you will be back in normal hours. However, the reverse happens if you play during horror hours on a save file made during normal hours.Thoughts?

43,"A multiplayer haunted house game in which AI demons will kill you and possess your body to kill the rest of your team. You can can avoid getting killed by demons by staying quiet on the mic and moving carefully, but then your teammates might kill you thinking you had been possessed. 
You walk a fine line between not getting killed by the AI demons and not scaring your teammates into thinking you were killed and are now being controlled by the AI. If you cry out for help over voice chat or voice commands, you might get killed by the AI, but if you stay too quiet while you approach your teammates for group safety, they might kill you with their melee weapons instead.****The premise is stupid simple: Self-proclaimed demon hunters from across Instagram group up to YOLO some abandoned hospital/mansion/gravesite/ect. (depending what map got chosen)... all to take selfies at randomized locations there ""for the gram."" Unbeknownst to them, demons are real. Real *vicious.* Now the influencers must split up to take their selfies at their designated locations as fast as possible before a portal to hell opens up ^(or someshit —I don't know, I haven't thought this far ahead. It's absurd though.)

45,"Two players. One is blind, the other is deaf. 
My first time posting here so forgive me for any issues. I'm not a game dev at all but I think this is a really really good concept for a game and I wanted to share it so it might inspire someone who can actually write a line of code. Basically it's exactly what the title says. There are two players, one is blind and the other is deaf and they have to communicate and rely on each other to survive a world of obstacles. There's no voice chat for obvious reasons so you have to figure out how to communicate with each other so you can navigate through the world.
 
"
46,"An RPG where your abilities are based on how the world perceives you and what they believe you are capable of. 
An idea for an RPG or Action-RPG that revolves around how legends are born and the power of belief.There is no level, talent or skill system. You begin as a generic, year zero peasant... farmer, soldier, sheep herder or whatever with some sort of goal to go on an adventure and make something of yourself. You have basic movement options like running climbing and swimming, can wield and use weapons in a pretty amateurish fashion, can pick up and move or manipulate objects. Now as you progress throughout the game from this point you will be given opportunities to prove your worth, accomplishing feats of heroism or villainy. These may include things like saving a child from drowning, defending a merchant waylaid by highwaymen, scaling a dangerous peak, surviving a bad fall, etc etc. Depending on who saw you do these things and how you did them tales will spread amongst the townsfolk. These will began as rumors but become more real as time progresses and will define your key traits and skills.For example let’s say you save this merchant from bandits and you do so by stealthily using a bow to pick them off. The merchant reaches the city and hits the tavern where he speaks of the wandering adventurer who slew 3 bandits with a bow without ever having been seen. You are now naturally stealthy and make less noise when moving, or maybe you have a smaller silhouette and NPCs need to get closer to realize you’re there. But what if the merchant says you must’ve hit those bandits from something like 200 yards and doesn’t really harp on you being quiet? You now have less arrow drop using the bow, or your arrows travel much further and faster. Maybe the merchant says you hit each bandit directly between the eyes and it was a sight to behold. You now have ‘deadeye’ capabilities or natural auto-aim.I imagine there would be a sort of “telephone” type system for this where each little tale would be twisted and exaggerated as it’s told and spread. You could reinforce the skill by duplicating a similar feat and make it better. But maybe you mess up and fail something spectacularly? Like say you’re running about town and trip over an object. Now the story is “he’s a crack shot with a bow but man does he have two left feet”. You now develop a wobbly gait and are more prone to being knocked over, losing your balance or tripping. I’m still workshopping a lot of this and trying to sort out some fun ideas and example situations. Like if people stop talking about you, you’ll lose these abilities over time. My thought is that this would exist in sort of an early dark ages settings with some fantastical elements and couched deeply in satire. As the tales are stretched out and over embellished you gain ridiculous powers but they can also become ridiculous negatives.Maybe someone watches you fall off a building and barely survive hitting the ground. As the story is passed it goes from a 2 story building to a 4 story one and then to a tower. Enjoy doing super hero landing and not taking fall damage you jump off of something. The core gameplay loop would consist of you just trying to go through life and follow some sort of simple plot (no idea on story yet) while the actions you take and how you decide to play the game can only influence and not decide what abilities you get. If you decide to use your fists to do the talking you’ll see rumors revolving around your brawling ability but as to what those rumors are you’ll have very little input. It may be that you gain incredible endurance because you fought 10 men at once, might be that you get hands of stone because they said you were KOing everyone in a single punch. I have a general idea of a subplot based on all the gods in a type of Olympus looking down from on high and basically using you as a guinea pig for gambling and placing wagers on. They’d give little inputs to screw up sure things, or make you succeed in a one in a million shot.Let me know if this doesn’t make sense. Will update more after I sleep a bit.EDIT: I wanted to talk about progression a bit. There is a theory with the Avengers that reason they keep fighting greater and greater powers, and finding more and more enhanced villains is that there is a sort of cosmic force that balances out evil rising to meet greatness. In the MCU at least it starts with Iron Man fighting terrorists and another engineer who built a suit. As the universe expands so does the roster and severity of each event.I would use a similar system whereas your legend grows so too do the challenges grow to meet it. If you become famed for your skill with a blade you’ll begin to hear about a certain master swordsman who’s making his way your direction. He finds you and challenges you to a duel at sunrise to prove who the greatest fighter in the land is. This could be a recurring rivalry similar to Gary in Pokemon or it could be a primary antagonist and this is a fight to the death, cementing your legend and leading in to a natural retirement for your PC.You’re a famed monster slayer or hunter of beats? You’re no longer fighting particularly aggressive boars, you begin to encounter more supernatural or mythological type creatures. A wolf the size of the mill, a hydra or a thunder hawk is terrorizing a town nearby and you are tasked with bringing an end to it. This could lead to an eventual face off with a dragon, golem or something.I’ve been thinking of this in rogue-lite fashion where every play through is drastically different and the main plot may be just there to give you some direction and get you traveling about the world. So it’s fine to leave characters you’re not liking and just start fresh immediately. The end game goal would be becoming a true legend which would lead in to character retirement and an epilogue.

47,"GAME IDEA TEMPLATE 
For some background, I'm an intermediate indie game developer who would like to see this sub grow. I know what it takes to make and pitch a game, and find most idea posts on this sub are missing the mark. Use the below template to ensure your idea can be translated into a game.       There is a TLDR copy/paste version at the bottom.            ----------  [TITLE] A one-sentence overview of what your game is all about. Ex: 'The player is a cat, hunting a mouse that lives in the walls.'[BODY]  **Name** (Your best idea for what the game should be called): 'Whiskers'   **Main Mechanic** (what the player will be spending most of the time doing): 'The player sneaks around the house, deducing the mouse's current hiding place through visual sound waves and scratching noises. When the mouse makes a break for the food, the player does everything they can to catch the mouse.'  **Side Mechanics** (secondary features to make the game more fun): 'Stealth and acrobatic movement, using the terrain such as couches and kitchen chairs to get around faster. Multiple mice on harder levels.'  **Story** (The main story idea if your game has one): 'The cat is left alone at the house, and must protect the food under a time limit until the owners get home.'   **Similar to** (games or references that your game relates to for added clarity, usually a 1-sentence pitch): 'Whack-a-Mole meets Assassin's Creed.'  **Advanced Features** (Features that could be added in if made by a strong enough team, but are not needed for the game to function): 'Mouse mode, where the player plays the same level but as the mouse instead of the cat. Multiplayer mode, with 1-2 cats and 2-4 mice. Co-Op mode with 2 cats or 2 mice, etc. Level design mode. Outside mode.'     ----------  While some of this stuff might seem extra, this information is really important for sharing something as complex as a game idea. It gives someone a foundation from which to build game mechanics, come up with a story and visual style, without becoming lost or confused by your idea.  If sharing a game idea with someone feels like you are telling them about a vague dream, then you probably need to think about your idea a little bit more before sharing.  TL;DR / COPY AND PASTE FORMAT **NAME:**   **MAIN MECHANIC:**  **SIDE MECHANICS:**   **STORY:**    **SIMILAR TO:**  **ADVANCED FEATURES:**

Every new run the player gets the randomly generated game world consists of his items, so the game starts more complex with every stage. What do you think? Can it be interesting?

If you aren't picked up, you can refresh to spawn ahead of some other ride.When you get picked up, you just hang out with people, talk, enjoy the passing scenery, stop at roadside attractions, get food at dive troughs, and all around have a fun road trip. Players can take turns driving the semi-automated vehicle.Once you're done, you can ask to be dropped off. Or worst case scenario, you jump out the window.What else can I say. I really enjoy road trips and they can make a great social setting in VR.

54,"Why does health or mana have to have non-negative real numbers / integers as values? Some more exotic choices... 
The most obvious choice would be to allow negative amounts of health or mana. Negative health might have something to do with undeath, a weird perverse state of being where healing potions bring you closer to death (defined as zero health) and damage from enemies makes you stronger. Maybe a world with living and undead beings side by side, with a matter-antimatter sort of relationship - the undead can harm the undead by attacking, the living can harm the living, but perversely, when either tries to attack the other, they heal instead.More weirdly, you might try using values in a cyclic group - the most obvious choice being the circle group - which for non-mathy people is ""pretend that 0=1 and the number line rolls up into a circle"". Then full health = no health (i.e. death), and healing too much would actually damage you - but if an enemy tried some sort of overkill attack, it would actually heal you instead by wrapping your health around ""below zero"" to a high number close to 1! This could be the outcome of an eldritch ritual that makes you a creature beyond standard laws of nature.Another choice would be a two-dimensional health bar. (Health square? Health circle?) The origin, or a small circle centered on it, would be death, and every other point would be a distinct health state. Attacks or healings would be vectors added to your health, with attacks tending to move it closer to origin, and healing tending to move it further away, but by some sort of ""life force rotation"" mechanic you might shield yourself, diverting an attack and turning it into something that heals you - but of course, your enemies can too. Or, if they can manipulate your life field, an enemy could curse you to take ""damage"" from a health potion this way. That said, you could ""spiral around the drain"" indefinitely without actually reaching death at the origin, if you're very careful!Weirdest of all, perhaps, might be health (note, any of these could apply to mana, currency, or any other value also, of course) that takes values on a tree - such as the free group on two generators. (Set of all expressions with two types of symbols that look like ""2a+3b-a+2b"" etc.) Reaching zero / death (the empty string) would require going backwards on the tree, retracing every step your health bar has taken all the way to zero, which would require the enemy to know your history - but of course, the same thing goes for damaging them. I can't even imagine how to describe that in terms of worldbuilding or meaningful analogies. But it's cool as heck.Feel free to use these ideas or not use them, however you like. But I love putting weird math stuff into game designs!

55,"A game where you literally watch paint dry 
It's like a walking simulator but for those who don't even feel like walking. You sit in a room with a single freshly painted wall. The room has no way out but it is furnished with some interactable items. A coffee machine. A coffee table. A coffee table book. Some items unrelated to coffee. You fuck around with them.The game is narrated by a British sounding man, supposedly the game's developer. Together you pass the time. It's not very fun. It's somewhat novel. It's very pretty.After a few hours, you walk up to the wall to check the layer of paint with your index finger. You weren't patient enough and ruined the paint job. Game over.

56,"I had this Horror game idea and I have to tell someone 
Maybe someone already thought about this idea but this is how it goes.Basically you know how most horror games are in complete darkness and scary ambient sounds and things cracking squecking etc.Well I tought about a horror game simply called ""Hidden in plain sight"". Watch this, its a bright sunny day birds a chriping sun is shining the grass is green everything is nice.You fell relaxed and safe. But the creature that is trying to get you is simply hidden in plain sight. You can spot it if you look good enough but it is so well hidden in the surounding and its just easing closer and closer.Now I would love to have people aswell and you walk trough them and maybe someone like behind you creapily goes 'Psst hey' and you turn around and its just a normal person like asking you for directions but maybe the next time it is not. The creature is extremly good at blending in.I dont know the objective, I have not tought about it thoroughly only the broad concept. Also I would not like a bullshit aproach to killing it like if you see it you can pop a 45. In his skull and the game is finished no collecting magic stone from my grandmother that she hid in her ass.English is not first language sry

59,"A game like the modern Hitman games, except with ""silent drop-in multiplayer"" (you aren't told how many players are sharing your world or who they are) and any player can get bonus scores for making another player get caught. 
It's a stealth game in levels full of NPCs and you start each single-player mission with a randomized character appearance. **It's not an assassination game;** rather, your story mission objectives range from things like stealing documents and finding a target's password, to planting bugs in a room and reverse-pickpocketing to plant evidence on an NPC. You still have some non-lethal combat options which are mostly used to steal disguises.The twist is that you can be dropped into a level that already has other players hidden in it going about their own story missions.####You can't assassinate each other.Instead, if you spot some NPC acting like a human *you can report them.* You see, a main feature of this game is the ability to mislead guards (and other NPCs) by walking up to them and reporting suspicious activity. You get a prompt to give them a description and/or location, which leads them investigate or call it in (which in turn might clear a path for you if they leave). If your shenanigans lead to them getting caught, you get a sweet bonus. You might even disguise yourself as a guard NPC to scare them into trouble if you're confident they won't realize you're just another player.There are more ways to mess with other players, such as throwing something loud near them, locking doors on them or planting a tracking device in their pocket (inventory), to name a few examples. Finding other players is a little rare (especially since they tend to be blending in as best they can), but it's just common enough that you're always on edge.

* Oxygen can be a core mechanic. Similar to how FTL does it, rooms take a while to refill with oxygen after a complete vacuum.* The spaceship could be a randomly generated set of rooms that players try to utilize best for killing monsters and having a safe place to retreat to.* For maximum drama have the doors open and close really slowly. So when a friend doesn't quite make it, we get to hear their anger/fear.

62,"Overrun - A ""cooperative"" battle royale inside a skyscraper in which survivors are being overwhelmed by non-stop spawning monsters and dwindling resources. 
100 players start on the lower floors of a skyscraper and race to the upper floors, looting along the way, as monsters flood-in after them.There is no ""safe zone""; rather, it's all about how well you can fight off (or run from) monsters while they slaughter everyone around you. Players can work together to barricade entrances or seal paths in order to force monsters (and other survivors unfortunately still back there) to use longer paths. The monsters come in waves, allowing survivors some breathing room to loot and break through to the next floors.####THE FINAL WAVE OF MONSTERS DOES NOT END  The top floor has a panic room, but it needs five people to operate the locking system. The first five people who make it into the panic room win... plus any survivors that slid under the steel door while it was closing. If any monsters made it inside, the game won't end until either the survivors kill the monsters that made it in or all the survivors die.Inspired by the trailer to A Quiet Place 2, I like the idea of running from monsters and knowing you are only alive right now because the monsters are distracted by other survivors.
 
"
63,"Don’t Nap - A game in which you are a preschooler, it’s nap time, and you don’t want to take a nap. 
Had this idea because I work at a preschool and a rendition of this is played every day at nap time. I have no knowledge of game design, so I’m sorry if the flair is wrong. I’m guessing the AI would be really difficult to program.- 3D unity game- Stealth-focused gameplay. Similar to Slender or Baldi’s Basics.________________Concept/tagline: It’s nap time at the preschool you attend. But you don’t want to nap, you want to play! So you must sneak around and play with all the toys. But watch out, if the teacher catches you, you’re toast!____________________- objective: There are several different toys (blocks, matchbox cars, dolls, etc) laying around a classroom. You must “play” with all of them without being spotted by the teacher. In order to play with a toy, you walk up to it, press a button on your keyboard/controller, and a 2 second progress timer bar counts down. After this, you have officially “played” with that toy and can move onto the next one. After you’ve played with all the toys, you get a message saying that you’re sleepy, and you must return to your cot. Upon returning to the cot, you win the game.________________________- The teacher: the teacher patrols the classroom. They get more vigilant after every toy you play with. Starting out just reading a newspaper; and actively searching for you by the last toy. If the teacher sees you, they give chase, and they’re faster than you so escaping is possible but not recommended. If the teacher catches you once, they put you back in your cot, and go into the hardest mode for the remained of the game. If you get caught again, it’s game over.________________________- Your cot. You start the game on your nap time cot. If you are on your cot, you are safe, and if the teacher sees you on the cot, they will return to their desk temporarily. Once you’ve played with a few toys, of the teacher sees your cot empty, they will actively search for you instead of passively patrolling._________________- Other obstacles. There are a few other obstacles to avoid that will alert the teacher to your location. The teacher will go to the obstacle to investigate, so if you trigger one, it’s best to get away from that general area as quickly and quietly as possible.- Loose items. Loose items can be knocked over if you’re not careful. They will make a noise that draws the teacher to them.- Squeaky floorboards. There’s a subtle visual cue for which boards are squeaky. - Tattletales. Some of the other sleeping children will get woken up if you get too close to them, and will shout “teacherrrr!” This draws the teacher to the kid.- Paint bucket. This is a loose item that can be knocked over and alert the teacher. However, it can also be used to your advantage. When the teacher finds the paint spill on the floor, they will spend ten seconds or so cleaning the spill and ignore you. It’s placed somewhere in the classroom where there’s not much cover, though. So it’s a high risk, high reward strategy.__________- Getting around. You can either walk or crawl. Walking is faster but louder, crawling is slower but more stealthy.

64,"You're an evil villain and by God you will monologue if it means the death of you! 
I dreamt this idea and I know it's kind of stupid but it's just meant to be a comical game that you wouldn't necessarily invest a lot of time in.The idea is that you're a supervillain and you must maintain the supervillain tropes or be laughed at by your counterparts. Sure you could easily kill the superhero with one shot to the head, but they won't die knowing your super evil plot!I imagine gameplay is something like, you have the superhero captured and you begin your monologue, maybe some dialogue cues are presented, but while you're doing this, you are also walking around the room checking to make sure the superhero is not planning an escape. Did they loosen the ropes their hands are tied in? Is their sidekick in the vents? Did they use their telekinetic powers to open the draw that contains the key to their shackles?I'm assuming there would be a point system based on time or something like that.I also thought you could have other stupid villain tropes, like you have to purposefully miss the superhero while shooting at them down the hallway, but they're so damn slow sometimes it's hard not to!I've only played it once (so this could be off the mark) but I imagined a 3rd person 5 nights at Freddy's type game play.Also, I can't believe there is a 'dream' flair lmao

65,"An Introvert’s stealth game 
Introverts are those with a strong preference for being alone. Some introverts avoid or even loathe the company of other people. Your case tends towards the extreme.As you walk out the door, make sure your neighbours don’t see you. Hide behind the cars, crawl underneath the hedges. Go as far as jump into the sewer. Throw a rock to distract them, wear disguises, 📦, etc - have all the stealth tropes in there, except killing.Everyone in this game either knows you or they don’t. Acquaintances will approach you, while strangers will not pay attention until you do something weird. If someone sees you snooping, they’ll speak to you regardless of whether they know you. In this case, you make an acquaintance and your friend list increases.The same people keep reappearing across levels, and it gets harder and harder for you to complete your quests, which range from taking out the trash to going to work to fighting monsters, because people keep approaching you, and you’re too shy to say you’re in a hurry.  You get money for quests, but it decreases based on how much time you wasted chatting with people. By being anti-social, you gain more but also lose out on opportunities. There are key players you absolutely need to talk to, but you have to wait for them to separate from their group.You can buy tools, upgrades and disguises which help you avoid people. You can build notoriety so people hate you, but that also makes it harder for you to complete some quests, by say losing access to vital people and locations. You can accidentally meet someone just right for you and start a family, bringing their piercing presence directly into your starting location. You can drop your job, your family and your name and move town for a lump sum, and restart with no one knowing you. The only thing that’s consistent is, at the end of every level, you will get testimonies from people about what a great, pleasant person you are to talk to.

It will never happen because money, but I thought of it whilst browsing r/destinythegame. would be interesting to follow at least.Edit: To clarify how I got the idea, every season in destiny 2, a community event will happen (which usually just consists of collecting resources and depositing them somewhere to tick up a percentage meter) but if it looks like the players are going to fail, Bungie just rig it in their favour. Got me thinking what would happen if the players actually failed.

The point of this thread it's to get an idea of what other players dislike about their favorite game genre and take those ideas to create a concept either to make it better or rework that very thing.i'm posting mine as example:FPS* *Guns that feel & look like a toy:* unless it about toys gunfighting then it doesn't apply, since the first doom, i think it's outdated the idea of small guns doing little damage, the pistol becomes useless the moment you get another weapon. In Return to Wolfenstein Castle, and Wolfenstein: New Order, did an amazing job for giving an use for the 'low' damage weapons.

68,"idk why we don't have an open world rpg that effectively teaches kids how to read by now 
I'm firm on the belief that video games are the future of education. You could fit 10x the amount resources into a video game no problem. At home learning wouldn't be an issue and neither would funding. These kids will do just about anything for in game assets. They'll figure out how to spell any word you give them if you hold character skins over their head. If we can give them that ability they'll be learning faster than you can say no. I can't imagine if this would've existed when I was a child. I understand that we lacked the technology then but we surely don't now. I feel that kids that don't know how to read would find it very beneficial to continue playing and learning about the things that they want to learn about. It'd be unimaginable to watch kids learning core curriculum at their own will.I'm not set on a specific way on how the game should run but it boils down to having everything labeled with words and giving the child the ability to spell these words for in game currency and better opportunities. When a character walks up to a cat they can pet the cat, feed the cat, and above the cat it says ""cat"". They can click on the word above/below/next to the cat and the game says ""cat, c, a, t, cat"". In another area they will be challenged to spell the word and be given in game currency if they succeed. The player should also be accompanied with a entity like Navi from the legend of Zelda that helps them to an extent with guiding them to accomplish each and every task the player is given.  The Navi would be the one spelling out each and every word the player clicks on. The world would be filled with multiple worlds. First we would give them a world full of words that start with the letter A, then the world of B's, the world of C's and so on. This would be the alphabet worlds where they can easily walk in and out of all 26 worlds with ease. Another area could be a city and contain all words associated with a city. The last area I can think of would be a world for nature.Just to create a video game like this and to make it as effective as I think it should be would equate to creating a multi million dollar development company with it's sole purpose being to education millions of children.  I find myself falling short. I wish it could be a free video game but if you can make a profit off of this idea, fucking run with it. This is only the start. I'd like to stay in the loop but more than that I want one of MY ideas to actually make it into the spotlight. I believe that my idea has meaning. This is the game I would've wanted as a child. Our education system is dreadful and everybody can attest to that. Further in developing a game like this I'm sure it'll change drastically over time. I really hope somebody takes the time to understand what I'm trying to say.

* Very minimalistic game in which you carry a single element: a torch.* You can use the torch you're holding in the following ways:   * as protection: while holding it and it is lit, enemies can't attack you   * to see your way through the dark dungeon   * to melee attack enemies (the fire goes out faster)   * to throw at an enemy setting it and other close enemies (if any) on fire in a kind of chain reaction. But after you throw the torch you are vulnerable to attacks.* There are torches on the walls of the dungeon as well that you can pick when you're next to them. The fire of these never go out while hanging from the wall.* Even though the game is turn-based, the fire of the torch you're holding goes out in real-time, putting some pressure on you to think fast.

70,"A horror sim game in which you play as a witch in Late Medieval Europe, you can cast spells, bewitch the townspeople, curse their crops/livestock/children, craft potions, create a coven, commune with demons - all while avoiding detection during the height of the witch-burning hysteria. 
This is my first post on this sub, so apologies if I get the formatting wrong!The game would have a rich character creation mechanic that would impact gameplay and storylines; for example an attractive witch might be more adept at seducing other people, while an old crone or geezer might have an easier time hiding in plain sight. Vampirism, lycanthropy and other shape-shifting abilities could also add to the player character’s options about what their perfect witch would be.  There would be a variety of skills that the player could master: conjugation, numerology, astrology, curses/hexes, transformation and shape-shifting, clairvoyance, necromancy, healing, potion crafting, medicine, offensive magic, telepathy and mind control, flight, resurrection, summoning, luck manipulation, ancient languages, animal familiars, and so much more. These skills could be learned and improved through different rituals or through books and grimoires. About the animal familiars, I think that they would be a fun game mechanic as the player could capture and nurture a familiar such as a cat, wolf, deer, serpent, raven, etcetera and train them to do their bidding, eventually getting to a point in which they can psychically “see” through the eyes of their animal familiar. Summoning entities would play a large part in gameplay, with the player being able to conjure demons that grant special powers/buffs/items or protect the player by attacking/possessing enemies. Necromancy would allow the player to resurrect the dead to serve as servants or assassins. The player could also commune with the dead to discover secrets they could use to their advantage. Crafting would be a huge part of the game, with potions, rituals spells requiring either growing ingredients oneself, buying or trading for them, or foraging for them in the environment. I’ve been doing reading about the kinds of herbs used by midwives and doctors in the 16th Century and I would apply this information into the game. (I’m a huge fan of inventory items in games that have deep lore and backstories for every single item, I feel like it adds to much in terms of world-building.)The player could join a coven or build one of their own followers, start wars with other covens, infiltrate a coven to take it over or destroy it from the inside-out. Lots of interesting story quests could come out of this mechanic. Or, the player could wield power through more legitimate in the “surface world” by becoming the court astrologer for a duke or becoming renowned and wealthy for selling tonics and tinctures with healing properties. Or, the player could just lie/steal/murder/magic/seduce/talk your way to the top, there would be so many different ways to play through the game. You could spend the game as a white witch growing herbs and making a fortune selling potions and the occasional love spell; or, you could summon Beelzebub and have entire cities under your thrall. The main challenge of the game would come from trying to do all these things undetected, which is difficult as even a rumor amongst the townsfolk could send you to the gallows or the stake. But as your skill set grows you can get to a point in which you are undetectable to any inquisitor, or - so powerful that armies fear you and you can do whatever you want openly; or, you become so charismatic that you charm even the pope and become the most powerful woman or man in Europe. I’ve been thinking about this game idea for quite a while and I think it could be a really appealing concept! I think it’d be really interesting to play a character that does things that are normally portrayed in video games as being “villainous”. There’s also something kind of subversive about having a game in which the main point is to undermine rigid puritanical and patriarchal systems.   Anyways, I just wanted to see if anyone else would be interested in a game like this and I’d love any suggestions or ideas about what to change, add or subtract. Thank you so much!

72,"What do all of the flairs mean? An explanation 
I feel like I don't see enough explanation for the flairs (Oftentimes, beginner is misused), so here is a quick run down.**Beginner** \- The game idea itself could be created by a single beginner in a couple of days. (Not that you are a beginner to this sub). **Example**: Pong, Tetris**Intermediate** \- A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of weeks to months. **Example:** Super Mario Bros, Don't escape 3**Experienced -** A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of years. **Example:** Spelunky, Iconoclasts.**AAA -** A game with a massive scope. Would need millions of dollars to make, and would require a large team \~200 people. (WARNING: If your game idea is AAA, it will most likely not be made. I'm not saying change the flair to experienced, I'm saying reduce the scope.) **Example:** Grand Theft Auto V, Persona 5**Dream -** A game idea that's so large in scope/technological limitation that it's impossible to make at the moment. **Example:** The OASIS**Abstract -** The game idea does not fit well into a pre-defined category, and is kind of a genre of its own, or it is a very weird/abstract game. **Example**: No Time To Explain, Manual Samuel**Meta -** What this post is.

73,"What if the game designer lies to you. 
A game which starts off in classic fashion: menu, options, start game, tutorial......but then, after you get the basics of the game, in follow up interactions with you, the game narrator and UI of the game itself start introducing information that is purposefully wrong and get you into trouble.After a while, it becomes obvious that the game designer is diagetic (in the game world) and is a character who tries to either make you fail, or use you to get to his own goals (which don't align with your own goals as a character or player). Hence, the game designer is the bad guy too.. xDI guess this is a similar idea to Stanley Parable (or Nier), and invites you to think about the following: how can the Game Designer lie to the player?I'm not talking badly designed UI or UX here, I'm specifically talking about ""lying"" to the player as a game challenge that the player must overcome. Maps with wrong information, tutorial pop-ups that invite you to do mistakes. Narrator that purposefully lie. And most interesting of them all....the game trains you on mechanics on one way, and then, throws a challenge that requires you to do the opposite of what you learned...
 
"
74,"An RPG where you only gain passive skills 
The game starts like a standard final fantasy type quest. There is a demon, you are about to leave a starting town to travel the world to find the means to defeat him. You leave the town walls and... the demon king is right there anticipating your quest.So you are stuck in the town. And it has a magical shield to keep the demon out, or whatever. What matters is, you can't travel. You can't fight monsters, you can't level up, you can't gain weapons or magic.You can only explore your town. And in doing so, you find you can interact with almost everything. You are stuck at level 1, but by taking the right actions, you gain jobs and passive skills. These skills help advance each other.For example, in the library, interacting with a bookshelves just makes you notice how many books there are. But if you have boosted your passive int by, say, talking to old people, you find you can pick out a book worth reading and learn about the town's history. Now you can find a trapdoor somewhere.There is a cat. Pet it, and you start gaining Cat Fancier skills. Learn to fish, then give the cat a fish. The cat brings you a bell that does something useful.Learn every job in town, and explore how skills from one help you advance another.You can fight the boss any time you feel like. He will always completely overwhelm you in power. But each round of combat, you can try some of the job skills you've gained, and at least one you could have will help you survive. Survive all the rounds because you have a broad enough skillset, and you win. Yay for you.

75,"A game where you are the universe's most important merchant. 
So you know how right before a big boss fight, there's always a merchant who sells you a bunch of stuff? You would play as that merchant. There would be some strategy involved when it comes to obtaining the best weapons/potions, managing money, etc. You would also have to park your station really close to where the boss entrance is and you have to track the heroes of the story to make sure you beat them to their location or the world is doomed. I imagine an eccentric character with a suitcase/backpack that unfolds into a portable merchant station. Maybe you would even have a pet falcon or a dog that can scout ahead and gather information about a good place to set up. This merchant's goal would be to acquire the absolute best material to increase the odds of the heroes' survival. There'd be all sorts of obstacles in your path.

76,"A platformer that purposely and ironically doesn't use common mechanics (like jumping). 
So basically the whole game would be written as sort of a comedic satire of trope mechanics in platformers, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and criticizing the player and developers.I imagine a tutorial where the player character gets to the first obstacle which is like a comedically low wall, and realizes that he does not have the ability to jump, breaks the fourth wall and says something to the effect of ""Who the duck doesn't know how to jump"". The rest of the game would be sort of like puzzles where you have to figure out how to progress through seemingly simple platforming scenarios where you use object and mechanisms to push, pull, throw you where you need to go. You could even break the fourth wall and use things like the window size or mouse cursor as game mechanics. All the while the player character mouthing off jokes at the ridiculous nature of it all.At the end of the game you would finally get the ability to jump but wouldn't be able to use it because the game is over. or maybe you could backtrack and see how hilariously easy the game is with the ability to jump.

77,"A game where the villain gets tired of waiting for the hero to arrive to fulfill his role and goes on an adventure to find him. 
The characters (npc) were aware that they are in a video game and that they must fulfill their roles, they did not mind dying because they would reappear later. The villain could always see the position of the player from his castle to have the whole environment ready and organized for when he arrives (something like he loves drama) but on one of those occasions after finishing the game and restarting the world the main character no longer appears on his monitor.The rumor that the main character has died without reviving spreads throughout that world causing no one to respect the roles and start wars for control for fear of dying at some point, and the villain tries to find him through the levels, having to beat the bosses who were in charge of him but now have become stronger to take control since they no longer need to be at a standard level according to their roles and they will also steal and use the items and weapons that the main character had to have used throughout the story

80,"Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better) 
So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/As I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.Other devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like ""MMO"". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Concept**----------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Idea size**----------------------------------------------------------------------------As I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Making the idea simple**----------------------------------------------------------------------------A LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Checking Before You Post**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Asking for money**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Good example**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.So, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.World set I thought of:A tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.Tell me what you think! :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Bad Example**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Overview**----------------------------------------------------------------------------The smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I recommend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.Edit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.

84,"An online election simulator in which every player tries to convince other players to vote for them in absurd, meme-filled elections for pointless government positions. 
When you start the game you're shown a simple map of a fictional country that is divided into states, then counties and then cities. Then you're randomly given a ""birthplace"" in one of those cities and an in-game fictional webpage to fill with whatever you want.Each city, county and state (along with the nation as a whole) has periodic elections for various fictional elected office positions like **Chief of Stuff** or **Secretary of Funk.** It's up to players to run for certain positions in their region and then convince other players to vote for them however they can. Joining political parties, petitioning other players in their regions on their webpages, running dirty political ads on the county newspage, etc. would all could be viable tactics.The fictional country would encourage user-generated lore and fictional issues like ""massive florb shortages"" or ""contagious Toe-Face outbreaks,"" along with players promising to fix such issues in their own silly ways.Everything is made up and the points don't matter.****I'll be brutally honest: I would expect lots of memes to laugh at, but also lots of toxic behavior to monitor/enforce against. The game would need to foster a player culture that keeps real-world politics out somehow.With just fictional maps, user pages, a voting system and image hosting, in theory the game could work completely on web browsers.

88,"A New Take On “Loot Based Gameplay” 
Instead of having a crap ton of duplicates filling up your inventory, or having a bogus ass ranking system where “Legendary” items are weaker then some Common items, why don’t we do this instead: every gear item is common! You get it once and that’s it, it’s in your inventory.But when you find a duplicate of that item, instead of hogging up your inventory it automatically upgrades the gear piece you already have! And ever one hundred levels (which would be really freaking easy to get to with so many duplicates), you can rank up that gear item to increase its rank, letting the *player* assemble a set of Legendary gear *through simply playing the game!*

89,"You're in a group call but some people can't hear each other 
The basic idea is that you're Discord voice chat with a group of people but unfortunately, some have muted each other and some have partially muted themselves (not everyone can hear them). No one has the information of who can hear who - you gotta figure that out by talking to each other.I thought of some specific implementations which seem fun:**Figure out the communication network**One person is assigned as the ""IT person"" who is here to fix this mess of a call. But first, they need to figure out exactly who can hear who. And they'll need some information relayed to them because they (probably) can't hear everyone else. The IT person will draw a graph of persons/connections and submit this ""IT ticket"" when they're done. Objective is to submit a correct IT ticket as fast as possible.**Task chaos**Kinda like Spaceteam, where people are constantly shouting instructions at other people to complete their individual tasks. Or it could be like a whisper down the lane/telephone style where one person is given a riddle and another person has the answer.**Hidden Eavesdropper**Everyone is given a unique secret key. One person is assigned as the eavesdropper, who can drop in and out of conversations of any connected group of people. Everyone else is a ""secretkeeper"". The eavesdropper needs to collect all of the secret keys, and secretkeepers only need maybe about half of the secret keys. (The eavesdropper does have the information about who can hear who from the start.)Additional elements?* bi-directional connections only, or also allow one-way connections* change the network of connections periodically during a round* add talking bots for additional persons

90,"Two character game, one blind, one deaf 
So basically a first person game where you have two characters ( one is blind and one is deaf) and your naviagating through a mansion or cave or seomthing trying to escape together. Obviously your characters are together, maybe linked so deaf character leads blind chracter. Your job is to escape the place your by finding hints and tools and what not about the location by seeing objects using the deaf character, and then swapping minds with the blind character to listen out for any noises coming from places, which would get louder or quieter if you turn towards it and move closer or further away from it, and then you can swap back to the deaf person, see where your blind friend has moved to, and figure out where the sound you heard was coming from and it would lead to more discoveries into helping you get out. The deaf character would have absolutely no sound in game, including menu and opening inventory and stuff, while the blind character could have a blank screen (maybe something on it to not completely make it black, or even better have a sound wave type thing appear if your facing a sound with the source (a dot) so you know where to move to to show the deaf counterpart the location). Hope that makes sense.

91,"A Heist Game, but with more planning and less shooting. 
I was inspired by this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/gb12uc/heistrobbing\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/gb12uc/heistrobbing_game/)   I've always wanted to play a Heist game with an Ocean's 11 suave vibe to it. I know of games like Payday, and GTA but these (though I haven't played them) seem too shoot-'em-up for my taste and don't really fit within the style I'd want.  They don't come with meticulous planning, and they're much too 'crash-and-grab'.  In my head I'd think there would have to be a much bigger RPG element to it, and 3 stages with 3 different styles of game-play:1. The Original Team. You have 3 guys to start the team, which will be expanded later. I think this could be multiplayer, as you would make a character who's good at specific job, and hire other players as well, but could easily be single player too, having NPCs you can select in place of your two buddies.2. The Research Stage. This is the RPG end of the game, you need to talk to informants find all the information you can about the mark, blueprints of the building, and work out what security they have. You need to know everything, as the success, and your ability to plan depends on what you can find out. You could even try threatening and bribing to get your info. Whatever works.3. The Planning Stage, and the New Team. This, in my opinion, would be one of the best parts to the game and it's major selling point. You use your knowledge of what you gathered in the previous stage to work out a rough plan of what you're going to do, and you then need to construct a new team to fit this plan. You create what you need with a budget, and cut corners where you can. This part could be half RPG when you're recruiting and getting contacts for the plan, but also strategy style blue-print planning part. I'm not sure exactly, but there should definitely be a load of catchy nicknames for the type of characters you need, and types of plans you could pull.4. And finally, The Execution. This is where things could go wrong. Very wrong. Depending on how you did in your Planning and Research stages, the execution might not go smoothly. You need to play your part to the plan and improvise any difficulties along the way. This part I feel should act kind of like GTA perhaps, with your team checking in on an ear-piece giving updates on the rest of the plan.That's as much as I've got right now, but if anyone would actually want to build this, I'd be glad to help out with concepts for GUI game mechanics or how everything could work. I'd love to try help out.  I doubt anything like this could ever be done properly without a big business behind it, but I'd love to eventually try out the idea myself one day.

Like all the words and letters get mixed up. (Except for the character's dialogue that pops up in text boxes of course lol.) But idk is this too realistic? Would it be too confusing to the player?

97,"A cyber-noir game about fast-travel, in which you track down and kill innocent ""outlaws"" who survived teleportation. 
The game takes place in a future in which teleportation booths are ubiquitous. **Fast-travel using these is central to the plot and to the gameplay.** Not just the player can fast-travel, but so can NPCs. They use it to get to work, to travel for vacation, to take their lunch break in Tokyo, etc. Society has accepted teleportation booths.#### It's no secret: Teleportation booths clone you and then kill you.The population has generally come to accept this. *You* always feel like *you* when you come out of the other side, after all. Unfortunately, teleportation booths do have a slim failure rate. Once in a while, the booths will fail to destroy the original. These survivors are disavowed by society and declared outside of the protection of law.This is where you come in. You play a marshal who is tasked with tracking down and eliminating these [outlaws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw)For each case you'll visit their home and workplace for clues to where they may be hiding. You'll interview relatives, colleagues, aquaintances *and even the rightful* clone himself/herself. The outlaw will also ping on a map if they were tagged by a nearby biometric scanner. Each case is like a detective mystery that may end in a confrontation or gunfight.### Fast-Travel as a Gameplay MechanicThe basic game idea came from wondering, ""what if fast-travel wasn't just a small gameplay feature, but instead was the core mechanic of a game?""The game world would be about as large as the several city hubs in recent Deus Ex games, just large enough to make fast-travel useful at walking speed (there's no need for cars in this future). Everyone can fast travel *except outlaws* since the network has already flagged them. The rightful clones of the outlaws are also affected since there's no way to tell them apart.This is important because any time an outlaw is pinged on the map, it means they *have* to be within a certain radius (based on time and walking speed). On the other hand, you can zip all over the place to check nearby scanners or to outmaneuver your target.It's so useful to you that it would be a shame if—in the final act of the game—a teleporter malfunctioned on you and now you become the hunted.
