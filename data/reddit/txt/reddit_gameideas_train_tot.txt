A cyber-noir game about fast-travel, in which you track down and kill innocent "outlaws" who survived teleportation. 
The game takes place in a future in which teleportation booths are ubiquitous. **Fast-travel using these is central to the plot and to the gameplay.** Not just the player can fast-travel, but so can NPCs. They use it to get to work, to travel for vacation, to take their lunch break in Tokyo, etc. Society has accepted teleportation booths.#### It's no secret: Teleportation booths clone you and then kill you.The population has generally come to accept this. *You* always feel like *you* when you come out of the other side, after all. Unfortunately, teleportation booths do have a slim failure rate. Once in a while, the booths will fail to destroy the original. These survivors are disavowed by society and declared outside of the protection of law.This is where you come in. You play a marshal who is tasked with tracking down and eliminating these [outlaws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw)For each case you'll visit their home and workplace for clues to where they may be hiding. You'll interview relatives, colleagues, aquaintances *and even the rightful* clone himself/herself. The outlaw will also ping on a map if they were tagged by a nearby biometric scanner. Each case is like a detective mystery that may end in a confrontation or gunfight.### Fast-Travel as a Gameplay MechanicThe basic game idea came from wondering, "what if fast-travel wasn't just a small gameplay feature, but instead was the core mechanic of a game?"The game world would be about as large as the several city hubs in recent Deus Ex games, just large enough to make fast-travel useful at walking speed (there's no need for cars in this future). Everyone can fast travel *except outlaws* since the network has already flagged them. The rightful clones of the outlaws are also affected since there's no way to tell them apart.This is important because any time an outlaw is pinged on the map, it means they *have* to be within a certain radius (based on time and walking speed). On the other hand, you can zip all over the place to check nearby scanners or to outmaneuver your target.It's so useful to you that it would be a shame if—in the final act of the game—a teleporter malfunctioned on you and now you become the hunted.

Urban combat revised 
An idea that’s been floating around in my head for a while is an idea for a Mmorpg that focuses on urban combat in a literal sense. I’m talking post-apocalypse, nitty gritty Mad Max meets The warriors type of game, with elements of Street Fighter and Sims Urbz mixed in.You’d have street gangs, turf wars, the mafia is in there, corruoted cops etch.Let’s say the game takes place in New York, the concrete jungle, a metropolis and a melting pot of cultures, you’d have different factions to level reputation with, like Chinatown, Harlem, upper manhattan and bigger hubs being the boroughs of the City of New York. This is just a loose idea that’s been in my head for some time and I thought I’d see what someone else thinks (I dont know the appropriate flair so @me if you know)
 
COVID Stealth game 
What if you had to eliminate all COVID cases and potential spreading in a few cities? You could sneak up on people without masks and mask them (a parody on the stealth kill mechanic) or try to drug and quarantine them if they are infected (sleep drug; nothing weird goes on) without getting caught by the police.This would simply be a joke game, with not a lot of substance. Don't kill me please. Thank you for reading this and feel free to make this game yourself!
 
Something like TF2, except only support classes, so you have to be creative to actually deal damage. 
 
Helpfull tools for gamedevs! 
Soooo, when I started (not so long ago) with game development, I din't know tools that are free to help me so I listed some helpful tools!\- **Hacknplan,** This is the perfect planning website, since I started using it I felt more satisfied and I make more progress. It is just perfect  \- **Adobe Xd,** This is free! And it is perfect for designing; websites, UI, etc.  \- [**draw.io**](https://draw.io)**,** No, this isn't a .io game where you draw. This is a program/website where you can make diagrams. This is very helpfull to get your ideas visualised.  \- **paint.net ,** This is a easy to use and free replacement for adobe photoshop; yes there are many good replacements but that is the one I used.  \- **MagicaVoxel,** This program is perfect if you can't model. I used this program to make basic models.  \- **Bosca Ceoil,** Even if you're not a musician you can still make something reasonable out of this. This is a free music program!  \- **Audacity,** This is perfect for audio effects and such things. I din't use this much yet because I din't needed it yet.That is my list! If you have other helpful tools you can list them in a comment!
 
A space based horror game without any sound. 
The basic idea is a first person survival horror game (in the vein of stuff like Amnesia/Soma/Outlast) set on a space station, in which you have to survive monsters genetically engineered to survive in hard vacuum (I'm imagining something in the vein of a gigantic, predatory tardigrade).  The twist is that, since the station has suffered a catastrophic vacuum breach, there's no sound outside of your own suit (edit:so you'd still hear your own breathing, radio messages and cooling fans and whatnot), so you're forced to rely entirely on your sight to sense enemies. Since I'd imagine a vacuum engineered predator would also be really good at sensing vibrations, you'd also need to be real careful about controlling your movement.
 
A game where you play as a spirit that can possess people 
I was thinking of an open-world fantasy game where you play as a spirit that can't interact with the world in any way except to possess people. Once you possess them, that person becomes your character. You can level them up, teach them skills, etc. but when you die that character is gone forever and you need to possess a new person. You can also leave people freely. The more you play, the more your spirit levels up and you can possess higher-tier people, going from simple townspeople to more influential people like nobility, and eventually really powerful characters like wizards and champion warriors. The quests are dependent on what type of person you possess.
 
City builder game where you build the city with cards and for good urban planning you get more of em 
 
An RPG where you only gain passive skills 
The game starts like a standard final fantasy type quest. There is a demon, you are about to leave a starting town to travel the world to find the means to defeat him. You leave the town walls and... the demon king is right there anticipating your quest.So you are stuck in the town. And it has a magical shield to keep the demon out, or whatever. What matters is, you can't travel. You can't fight monsters, you can't level up, you can't gain weapons or magic.You can only explore your town. And in doing so, you find you can interact with almost everything. You are stuck at level 1, but by taking the right actions, you gain jobs and passive skills. These skills help advance each other.For example, in the library, interacting with a bookshelves just makes you notice how many books there are. But if you have boosted your passive int by, say, talking to old people, you find you can pick out a book worth reading and learn about the town's history. Now you can find a trapdoor somewhere.There is a cat. Pet it, and you start gaining Cat Fancier skills. Learn to fish, then give the cat a fish. The cat brings you a bell that does something useful.Learn every job in town, and explore how skills from one help you advance another.You can fight the boss any time you feel like. He will always completely overwhelm you in power. But each round of combat, you can try some of the job skills you've gained, and at least one you could have will help you survive. Survive all the rounds because you have a broad enough skillset, and you win. Yay for you.

Conker's Bad Fur Day spiritual successor in which we play as his bastard child in a very meta plot 
The protagonist goes on a very meta quest to escape Microsoft's limbo of dead IPs and obtain their own game.Not flat out stating that their Conker's child, but implying it heavily to make the connection to the originalNot sure what the gameplay would be, probably a jumble of some with commentary about them
 
2 years in the making, No motivation left. Any Ideas? 
 NOTE: To make this clear and not get this removed from this sub, I am asking you guys for ideas on how to get more motivation and hear your game ideas. Thanks!.I am a very young developer still in my high school years looking to make a really cool experience for gamers around the world to play. What motivates me the most is opening the analytics page and seeing how many people have downloaded my previous game (it sucked). I really just want this game I have been working on to be seen and thats my one big source of motivation.As I continue to work on this game I have just lost all motivation. I feel it will be a dry release and all my hard work has gone no where.I would love for some feedback and dont take this as my crying for support I just really want to finish this game and have the motivation to get it in the hands of you guys.The general thought of the game is very close to the hit game rn phasmaphobia (not copying I started working on this game 2 years ago Im just referencing general feel of game), no ui, vr supported, extreme graphics, and scary atmosphere.Here are some screenshots out of the game engine: (NONE OF THESE PICTURES ACTUALLY HAVE THE \*\*LIGHTING BUILT ON THEM\*\*, THESE ARE JUST ROUGH SCREENSHOTS TO SHOW MY OLD DEDICATION TO THIS PROJECT, the real game when lighting is built has a lot less yellow and fog.)[https://imgur.com/a/jfWnLJc](https://imgur.com/a/jfWnLJc)Thanks everyone for reading. All the advice I can get, stay safe.
 
A dangerous checkpoint racing game on extremely open courses; when the checkpoint is reached, its replaced with a new checkpoint somewhere randomly ahead on the track. This leads to everyone still behind to cut off-road across the track to reach the newest checkpoint first. 
* The track is relatively safe & simple. Driving *off* the track is tricky and dangerous.* The circuits have tons of curves and bends, and you can go as far off course to get to the next checkpoint (or if you are really far behind, further ahead where the next checkpoint might spawn).* Cars take damage that can affect performance. If you're driving off-track, you'll be assuming many more risks.* Reaching a checkpoint awards 1 point. First player reach the point limit wins.I'm going to be honest: I never played Midnight Club Racing, but from what I barely remember this might be how it played? Let me know if this is true. I mean the part about a checkpoint disappearing and spawning somewhere else as soon as someone reaches it. Personally I imagined something more like Star Wars Pod Racer or F-Zero in which the vehicles are fast and fragile, except you don't have to stick to the track at all.
 
An FPS where you get a bio of every faceless mook you kill 
Pretty much what the title says.  Every time you kill a guy, there is a popup you can stop and view that tells you who you just killed, why he or she is there, what their hopes and dreams were, and who they are survived by, if anyone.  Maybe some of these could be carefully human-written, but for most of them I think you'd want to have them be mixed and matched from pieces; but there should be enough pieces that it never seems repetitious.  I mean, the meta-narrative purpose here is obvious enough.  But if you wanted to get really dark and sick with it, in an open world game, you could also list the home address of their relatives.  LEAVE NO ONE TO TAKE REVENGE.  Ideally this would be accompanied by said faceless mooks having highly detailed and individualized faces.  
 
A time travel type game where timing is everything 
Something extremely bad happens, like a nuclear bomb goes off, for example. The player collects information from their surroundings for a certain time limit and then are put back in time with the same time limit. It goes back and forth as the player collects more information to eventually stop the extremely bad thing happening.I understand this might be a bad explanation, feel free to ask questions and I'll try my best to answer them.
 
Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better) 
So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/As I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.Other devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Concept**----------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Idea size**----------------------------------------------------------------------------As I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Making the idea simple**----------------------------------------------------------------------------A LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Checking Before You Post**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Asking for money**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Good example**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.So, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.World set I thought of:A tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.Tell me what you think! :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Bad Example**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Overview**----------------------------------------------------------------------------The smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I recommend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.Edit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.
 
A Dungeon Crawler, quite literally 
You were on some epic quest, but unfortunately your whole lower body got ripped off, and now you have to make it through the dungeon without dying by enemies or bleeding out.This might be the stupidest idea I had so far, but it sounds like fun.
 
Atmospheric liminal exploration game with heavy focus on visuals 
Essentially a game where a massive focus is put upon visuals and atmosphere, where you explore a world on foot in first person. It would be bleak and wet, and have a highly realistic artstyle similar to that of the art of [Simon Stalenhag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXCKGrDWylE&list=FL2o5Qjy0UoPfQZfV3m9S6kg&index=4&ab_channel=IlyaPlotnikov). It would be extremely liminal, with no other npcs or players to interact with. Check out /r/LiminalReality to gather an understanding of the feel. The world would be very heavily detailed and on a realistic scale. It would take place in a lush valley area somewhere on the pacific coast, with a town and surrounding mountain woodlands. It would be eternally drizzling, and everything would be damp. It would be permanetly dusk as well, with just enough light to see. You would walk through this valley and search for clues to uncover the mystery of who you are and why the town you're in is deserted. All buildings would have a detailed interior, and you would need to search through them to find newspaper clippings, books, dvds, flash drives, etc. This idea may not be for everyone but I feel it would be a chill, relaxing, atmospheric game. To be fully honest, I've wanted a game with this specific aesthetic, where you could just walk around and explore for years now. It wouldn't be a gripping or highly interesting game, but I feel it would be a nice idea for a relaxing, visually appealing game.
 
A mobile game made by ea 
In this ea game, you enter you credit card info, and then try to dodge enemies coming at you, but every time you get hit, ea extracts $1 x number of times hit.
 
A post-apocalyptic game where all your information is from before the apocalypse 
So for instance your map of a city would be for the city as it was before the apocalypse, meaning you can't rely on it completely while exploring. I just thought this was a cool idea IDK
 
I plan on making this, just want public opinion on it. 
I’m a newer developer, but wanted an idea of if people think this is an interesting game and if they would play it or not.Expo Centre Tycoon;Like a city builder, build a Expo Centre from the ground up. Build Halls and eateries, book talents and events, hire staff, and turn a profit! Start with a basic expo centre with events like small concerts and expos and work your way up by building and purchasing land to expand your empire to build things such as an arena and public transit. Sign naming rights, major sports contracts, and more!Any and all feedback appreciated! Thank you!
 
game in which your hero levels down instead of leveling up. So each time you make progress, you have to choose which skill to get rid of. And like that until you're left with only 1 skill. 
 
Awesome video game concept 
Ok so This is up for grabs for whoever wants it but I want credit for the idea, I thought of a cool concept where you are playing a character in an adventure game (3rd person view) and the character goes on these adventures thinking everything is normal, then throughout the story the character you are playing becomes aware of u and starts to fight over control of their body, and eventually there will be a part in the game where u sometimes lose control of the character and they do whatever they want, how I thought about it is it being a story driven game where u can do side quests and stuff like that but the character takes control whenever they want to and will be random or maybe one of u can come up with something better, again it’s a concept, I find it to be a unique idea and if anyone wants to make that into a full fledged game please make sure to give me some credit for the idea my Instagram is dorman1969
 
Any ideas for how I could turn this planet simulation into a game?

Dream Manager 
In the Afterlife, we have to continue to work the grind and as luck would have it, you are in charge of people's dreams. People need a good balance of paradise and nightmare in their sleeping mind so that they don't get out of hand. Its your job to give people nightmares and good dreams both in healthy supply so they don't go nuts. Your clients start out as few, just three people to manage their sleep. Easy enough, just experiment and find out what they like or hate so you can use these in their dreams. Remember you need to balance between nightmares and dreams of paradise or they will begin to snap in the waking world and you will get demoted. You might end up having to manage someone's love life...As the game progresses you gain more "clients" and have to manage more dreams. If you slip up too many times on what scares someone or makes them happy and content then you will begin to get a warning meter that they are not balanced and could slip into needing medications or snapping altogether.You start out with a smaller pool of resources for both scares and good dreams but these resources expand as the game goes on. Also as the game goes on the number of acceptable "losses" of people to medications or snapping will decrease. You can work towards Dream Manage of the Month, the Quarter, and the Year as well as becoming the CEO of Dreams.That's my idea so far :)
 
Using your own corpse from previous runs as source of material. 
Please excuse any grammar error, I'm not English native. I was thinking of some top-down or isometric real-time rpg, heavily inspired by Hyper Light Drifter in style and basic combat mechanics, where every time you respawn years passes and your old corpse crystallizes, morphing your stats into solid elements used to forge new items. To avoid repetitive gameplay I thought to add rogue-like elements in a fixed world, for example some routes closing and others opening each run. I'm still thinking if it'd be better to implement checkpoints or pure rogue tabula rasa character. The idea started from the concept of an elemental world, where each of the four elements have a corresponding body-part and statistic (fire = arms = strength, earth = legs = movement/defense, air = chest = hp/stamina, water = head = magic). You would increase your statistics defeating specific enemies, but you cannot upgrade your weapons or abilities without the crystals. You would craft abilities and items from a 2x2 grid, using maybe various degrees of crystallization of the same 4 elements. I don't mean your dead body to be the only source of crystals (maybe you can find others adventurer's bodies along the way) but it'd be the main.I imagined the world a little lighter than HLD's and with less neon, with a wider set of environments.Another feature I'm thinking about is having to build yourself every stat visualizer, otherwise you don't know how much health or magic power you have left. Maybe it would be a bit weird and very hard to adapt for new players while the experienced wouldn't need the indicators, but I like the idea of not having your stats displayed unless you build something to read them. Alternatives are welcome. I'd surely add visual indicators on the character body (colored aura or brightness) if I removed the HUD.
 
A game where you own a dungeon and you protect it from heroes... but Chromebook friendly 
There was something like this on itch, but I lost it so now I'm trying to find a good equivalent and/or find the game
 
A Liminal Space Adventure type game 
You go shopping at a grocery store and find a mysterious blue door at the very back of the store, you enter it and end up on level one, airport. Walk through the airport finding notes of other people who were stuck in this endless liminal space. Walk through this empty unnerving airport and find the second blue door. After more blue doors you go though you end up in more liminal spaces, flat grasslands with just blue sky and clouds, forest, hotel that looks oddly familiar, city area with no people and cars just keep going through the doors and also try to find a way out of this dream-like dimension.
 
A Racing Game where all of the Cars are terrible. 
So instead of driving Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, Corvettes, etc, etc. You get stuff like the AMC Gremlin, Mustang ii, Chevy Vega, etc, etc.
 
A Battle Royale Game, with Cooking-themed mechanics: Kitchen Royale/Rumble 
A videogame where 100 players try to make the greatest dish in existence in an island full of thematic places while they juggle with finding ingredients and defeating enemies with cooking-styled weapons (Frying pan, Egg launcher, Pie Cannon, Fork Launcher, Abnormally Large Spoon, Cupcake Grenade, etc.)You can use any ingredients you like, be creative! (Corn Juice, Orange Hot Dog, Meat Lover Cake, Blueberry Shake).Ingredients come with diverse value (Common, Epic, Legendary, Mythic, etc.)Choose from a wide range of chefs, bakers, amateurs and many more. (Chinese food, Mexican Food, French Baker, Teenager, Biker, Cheerleader, Clown, Japanese Schoolgirl, Idol, Football team Mascot, etc.)Visit thematic places to find the perfect arrange of ingredients or recipes (Wild Jungle, Chinatown, Mexican Pueblito, Roadie Zone, Galactic Diner, The UltraMarket, Eclair Town, Street Empire, etc.)Everywhere is your kitchen! From Campfires to professional gear. There's no limit.No pay to win, no pay to play, all free to play!An exclusive battle pass with lots of good stuff to unlock! (Chefs, gear skins, emotes, sprays, wallpapers, and your own custom lobby with furniture, food, electronics, etc.)How can I win you may ask... It's easy.1. Be the last chef standing and reach to the podium zone.2. Give one or more plates in one of many of the Goddess offering tables and she will rate any of them with scores from 1.0-10.3. (Squads Only) Be the squad with the most points at the end of the match or eliminate the other squads to win.Seasonal Events: The party doesn't stop! You can participate in many of the events throughout the year, with exclusive dishes to make and stuff to get.Time of cooking: Depending on your ingredients, you can take up to 1 second to 15 seconds. If you're being under attacked, you can pause your cooking and the time will resume after that. You can't use your own dishes as healing items. Look out for Bandages and Shield Protectors for help.It is more important to make those dishes than eliminating rivals, so get cooking.The Rotten Zone: Time is gold, so a certain part of the map will be starting to darken out. All ingredients inside of that some will be rotten if you don't grab them quickly. Believe me, the Goddess and the Counselors will not like any dish with a rotten ingredient. And be careful, because you will rotten out too!You'll be starting in the Chef's Zeppelin, where you will decide the place you want to drop. And after that, is up to you!This is one of my many game ideas that have been locked in my mind for a long time, and I'm happy to share them, bit by bit.Let me know what you think about it.Cheers and let's get cookin'.:)
 
Let me hear Your ideas for a Space Station Management game! 
Hello, my current project is one of the earlier aspirations that led to RimWorld. A management style game, but set in space onboard a space station. Combining this with ideas and the hostiles from Space Station 13, I'm sure there are plenty of interesting mechanics that can be explored. Basically a top-down strategy game where you manage your spacemen.Nevertheless, I would also like to hear what you like/would like from this style of games - or better yet, what you don't like about them. Bigger ideas, smaller mechanics, ideas for the control scheme and anything are all welcome!
 
An RPG in your dreams where you can only win by growing as a person. 
You awaken in a strange world full of surreal things, where space does not function as it should, and perception warps, and quickly discover that everyone in this world knows you, despite you not knowing them. They all readily explain themselves, of course, as though read from a script, until it's revealed: you're in REM sleep, the world between dreams. But soon, you'll have to enter a dream, and when you return, you'll forget everything.Each dream, although potentially not apparent at first, represents some flaw in the main character, which could be solved by self-improvement. Correlating to each area of improvement is a gameplay mechanic which the world of the dream is built around-- for example, the main character's anger issues are struggled with in a beat-'em-up world, while fears are encountered a horror stealth world, etc.Over the course of the game you'll go through multiple nights, facing more challenging worlds as you go. While they are connected by gameplay, the worlds are not connected by continuity, so each night you will go through multiple small stories, each world having their own. Every so often, you'll be brought back to the world between dreams, which slowly grows more congruent and memorable as you grow 'stronger' through your dreams, a fact the various characters all take notice of.Between your dreams, you are told, or perhaps get to see, what your character did that day. Because you're only his subconscious, dreaming self, you don't get any direct input in these actions.>!Kind of a new spin on this flair, I thought!<
 
First person where you can't see while you move 
Kind of remenicent of super hot but it plays like mirror's edge.
 
Ant Simulator Simulator: a game where you collect money to spend on booze and strippers 
 
Battle Royale Night Edition, With elements of survival (Zombies) 
So, I have this idea for quite awhile now, but haven't posted it since I needed to iron out all of its details until it's fairly complete. It's not going to be a short post so just bear with me here.I've been playing the BR genre for some time now, and while I'm not a huge fan (playing MOBAS mostly) I do have a couple dozen hours or so on PUBG (I don't play fortnite, never really gotten into it)One thing is missing in my opinion, in the genre, and I realized what it was, at least for me. The thrill and excitement of the first time that you're playing a battle royale, quickly changes into just competition as you play it more often. And while by itself it isn't really a bad thing, I do believe that I takes away a big chunk of the experience and simply turns it into an almost tedious task, which makes it hard for any BR game with maintaining a stable player count without the players ditching for other games.And so here's my idea. A BR game that should get your blood pumping and your heart racing more than once, or twice. Each play through should feel unique, and here's how.PLOT:The game has a light plot (or story) behind it. The year is 2046, the entire population of the world got infected in a virus that basically turned majority of the population into zombies. If that is not enough, the planet's rotation had extremely slown down, leaving half the planet in an almost eternal darkness, and limited resources. Earth Is no longer a suitable place to live on.Some people discovered that they are in fact immune to the virus, and therefore now have to fend for themselves amidst all the chaos. Other than those, a special unit of police forces was kept alive as well (using special equipment that allows them to survive, like gas masks), in order to try and prevent the remaining civilians from killing each other while trying to get resources in every way possible, including killing, which leads me to the two classes the game has: CLASS SYSTEM: AUTHORITY VS REBELLIONLike I just mentioned, the game will be divided into two groups, in which players will be able to engage in. The first group will be the rebellion, these are the citizens who stayed alive, are armed, and ready to go hunting and scavenging for supplies.The second group will be the authority, which as you already guessed, the police task force that was sent to eliminate the rebellion. However, the Authority can turn on each other and they don't have to follow some code of friendly fire, this is the end of the world after all, meaning that teams and players from the Authority WILL have to face other teams from their side and vice versa.  Please note that while it sounds like Authority will have the advantage in terms of weapons and technology, the game is meant to be balanced enough to a point where it won't matter which role you'll end up getting, and the differences between the two classes will only include slight advantages in both ways.The game will allow a single player team and up to 4.In order to create an organic gameplay, players (or teams) won't be parachuted into the map, but instead will be randomly placed and scattered on it in various locations, in order to prevent rushing to the same spots and locations right at the get go. Let's talk about the map shall we? MAP AND ENVIORONMENT: This is basically the core of the game, and the most important aspect of it as well. The map size will be around 10x10 square kilometers, and will be consisting mostly of a large city in the middle, a sprawling urban area with lots of buildings and a suburb area, all being either abandoned or swarming with zombies. Around the city there will be some open areas with a lake, a river and some tiny villages here and there. The time of the day, as you guessed it, will be at night. But it won't just be a night as it appears in most games – I'm talking about an almost pitch-black night, with only the light from the moon, your flashlight or a working streetlight guiding your way. Most of the city is under complete darkness, some streetlights are working here and there, but players will be able to shoot them and decrease the visibility in that area. Imagine being chased by a rebel, you both running in the street and he's after you. finally you reach a dead end and have nowhere to go. You realize you're in a light zone area, you shoot the nearest streetlamp and it all goes dark. Suddenly you have the advantage, you hide behind a car and surprise that motherfucker with a rail of bullets to the neck. The idea of darkness has a big impact on how the game will play, since there are other entities in the world other than rebels and Authority – and I'm talking about the zombies.The zombies themselves can be attracted to players both by hearing them or seeing their light emitting sources (flashlights, laser targeting devices etc) so it won't be too wise to just open fire at every occasion you have, because it'll draw a lot of unwanted attention, from both players and zombies. It basically means that if you enter a building, and find a good spot to snipe someone, you should take into consideration that there might be a passing zombie horde down in the street, and your shot might give them an excuse to enter and check out the building when you're in it, leaving you the choice to either jump for it or try to fight your way down the halls, killing everyone in your way. Imagine how scary it can be to enter a nice lonely suburb house, search for some ammo, and have a zombie charge at you from one of the dark rooms, and you have to fight that fucker or make a run for it. Without knowing what can be hiding right across the street, right across that room or just a floor above you in the same building,  players will stay on their feet the entire playthrough or until they die. The game won't feature an active map (in the corner of the screen), so it means that if one of your team members lost his way while searching for stuff, the entire team will have to help him getting back together or try to save him if he gets caught, based on environment description only. Zombies will be present in various ways across the map. They can go solo and roam around, or they can come as a horde, which will force the players to make quick decisions on how to get around from point A to point B. another thing to point up regarding the city – most if not all the buildings and houses should be completely accessible, giving the players the chance to both search for items and find shelter during their playthrough.  WEAPONS AND ITEMS: The weapon range and variety in the game will be rather big, ranging from light pistols to some heavy-duty machine guns and sniper rifles. Various attachments can be found and equipped on the weapons seized, and some of them will include scopes, laser targeting sights and more. RPG's, grenades and C4's will also be present. Night vision equipment will be in the game, but getting ahold of it is going to be incredibly hard in order to preserve the balance of the game, so these kinds of items would be very rare and not easy to find to begin with. It's also important to stress that both classes will start the session with some items and weaponry from the get-go, including at least one melee item in order to have a chance against zombies in the early game.Other items in the game will include various types of foods to regenerate health and stamina, different types of shoes (some really quiet which is useful, other less quiet but increase your running speed, good for other situations) and also armor vests and helmets. Each player will also have a flashlight right at the beginning of the match, the batteries on these can run out but you can find new ones along the way. The use of flashlights is not always recommended, and for obvious reasons. However, if you want to signal your location to a team member, this can be a good way to do it if they got far.The game will have some cars, but even if you or your team manages to get a working one, you'll probably want to drive with the lights off to avoid detection as much as possible, if the sound of the engine won't turn you in first. Some cars won't have gas, but it is possible to find gas and use it for that purpose. END GAME AND VICTORY Like in other BR games, the last surviving player or team wins the match. However, the game won't feature the traditional "circle" that pushes players towards a randomly selected center, and instead will overrun some areas with so many zombies, that players will have to get away from those areas and find new places to settle, until eventually players from all across the map will find each other roaming the streets and houses and close fighting encounters break here and there, as often as the game progresses till the very end. Matches should take between 30 to 40 minutes and sometimes even more. I don't want the matches to be too short, and I want each player to play at their own pace in order to build up the tension and enjoy the immersion of having to fend for your own, unassisted majority of the time. So that's pretty much it, that's my dream concept for a battle royale, and I'm pretty sure it'll be a very controversial concept for many, specifically because of the night setting. But I can assure anyone who's worried about it, that it can be super refreshing compared to what we have today. It poses a way bigger challenge because not only players will be struggling with a lot less visibility, they'll have to differentiate from other players to zombies, not an easy task under all circumstances. Tell me what you guys think, and if you have any questions feel free to ask them below, I'll do my best to answer. Thanks for reading!
 
Help us choose the most intriguing hero! 
Howdy everyone! It’s me again! I'm a game developer and we are currently preparing a zombie-themed tower defense game. We've made a lot of work on character designs, but are not sure which ones would be more attractive in game. So we'd like to collect some of your ideas. Which of the following characters do you prefer?We have put much effort into this game, and we hope it can become a popular game among players. So we post here, wishing to get players' preferences, ideas and suggestions for the characters we designed, and then to modify and innovate our existing materials accordingly~ Thanks in advance![Photo link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831462507880513557/832437251446538250/image0.png)

A "role-playing game" in the truer sense of the word 
I've played almost all popular videogame RPGs (Fallout 1-4, The Elder Scrolls 2-5, the Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Mass Effect 1, you name it) and although I LOVE videogame rpgs, I have to say: they are NOT role-playing games. The game industry has forgotten what tabletop RPGs were all about: Immersion, creating your own story, being whoever you want. For example, lets take a look at Skyrim (the game that basicly set the standard for western RPGs) - sure, you can customize your character and give it whatever name and stats you want, but you always play through the same story - Alduin will always be defeated by the end, the thiefs guild will always be there in Riften for you to join, you're always the dragonborn, etc; It feels like a linear game with a single gigantic level.So, I have a solution for that: a game with no main story whatsoever, but rather a really complex popularity system with lots of kingdoms/cities on which you can get jobs/contracts that after completion would give you a reward and a change of relationship you have in the world (for example, if you do a job for the king of a city, you gain popularity with them but lose with that cities enemies; if you become a assassin you lose your popularity with the peasants; etc) that not only applies to guests - if you become too rich you lose your popularity with the lower classes, if you travel enought/do heroic acts your fame will increase making more guests available. And of course, character customization.This could work really well in a procedural world, but I'll leave that for you, the reader
 
An RPG where you start off with a ton of fancy gear, but you have to strategically sell it piece by piece to afford the next level. 
The game takes place in a tower with multiple levels, and each level costs one piece of gear to move forward. The game also lets you exchange gear at certain checkpoints. Every enemy can be beaten with zero gear, but doing so requires a great amount of skill. The skill is built up from finding ways to survive without the gear.
 
Single gun with runes that you can combine to apply different behaviors, instead of having multiple different guns 
I was thinking about this for a shooter 2d platformer. Instead of having multiple guns and switching to one or the other, you have a single gun to which to can attach/insert different runes that can perform different things. A rune belongs to a certain category (eg: type of recoil, power, muzzle) and you can have only one rune of a certain category at a given time, but you can combine runes of different categories as you wish.Examples:- recoil: there'd be a rune with a hell of a recoil that even allows you to jump in the air in a sort of dash when aiming to the ground- power: one rune that when the gun is shot does a lot of damage and another rune that just throws air which could be used to hover while having the button pressed, and maybe approach enemies without being noticed.- muzzle: a rune that lights the whole room when shooting the gun but lasts just a fraction of a second, and another rune that shoots a laser beam that while keeping the button pressed lights up just a little bit around the beam.Etc.Does this exist in any game? Does it sound a stupid mechanic or can it have potential?
 
How do I make you experience people in a distinct fighting game? I want each character to have a different experience 
I want to make for each character a different experience from the other character, but I want each character an idea such as abilities or something else because I want a new idea
 
Night Train (indie/mystery) 
A casual indie game where you must solve a mystery onboard a night train... *that you control*.Instead of playing as a detective, or a well-meaning passenger, in this game you would play as the train itself. From an unobtrusive overhead view of each car, you must listen in on conversations, catch glimpses of key evidence, and note the behaviour of passengers - without being able to talk to them at all.**Goal:*** Solve the mystery of the Night Train, before it reaches its unknown destination at sunrise.**Features:*** Time moves linearly - if you want to hear a conversation, you have to be there at the right time. Notice suspects' patterns and associations.* Inhabit cars and move between them instantaneously, with an overhead view of the compartment.* Control minutiae such as lights, temperature, etc. - whatever you have to do to solve the mystery.*Note that this is a very rough draft. I have not actually written the mystery or the characters yet. This is just how I imagine the game.*
 
A game where you collect music notes to cast spells with a flute. 
**The Basics** (put these and I'll be satisfied): My idea would be a 2D platformer with a fully connected world, similar to Hollow Knight or Ori, and your main (maybe only?) companion is a flute. You can find music notes scattered around the world or dropped by enemies, and use them to cast spells that you learn by finding scrolls.**The Extras** (stuff that I'll put in if I decide to make it myself and would make me extra happy):* At resting spots, leftover notes transform into experience to level up HP, max notes per spell, and note capacity, a tiny bit like Zelda 2 (but not really)* A flute UI that actually makes you "play" the notes yourself**The Pretty Please** (c'mon it would mean a lot to me): References in the form of leitmotif spells with effects referencing their source materialThis is my first post here and also I can't guarantee I won't stop being lazy and make it myself, so keep that in mind :)**EDIT**: I used [yourgameideaistoobig.com](https://yourgameideaistoobig.com) and got either $6,048 and 1 month, or $9,072 and 2 months if you want to go "all major platforms." And if you just do the Basics and not the Extras, it's $3,360 and 3 weeks.
 
The Obverse - A 6v6 hero shooter with some interesting "new" mechanics. 
Below is a summary of the core mechanics. The full concept is available [here](https://www.notion.so/The-Obverse-a18896b977584b269a27bcf7caba2754)!I'm in love with hero shooters since I bought Overwatch back in 2017. The idea of battling for objectives with various different heroes with their unique kits and playstyle excites me a lot. Lately I've been imaging a game of this genre with some of my ideas poured into it, and since I don't have a big studio nor am I experienced enough to develop anything yet, here it is.Set in a dystopian future, The Obverse is what happens when technology goes straight into a 1v1 with the supernatural. Two different factions fight against each other in a few special gamemodes, each having their own specific role in the mode and heroes to choose from. In order to differentiate this game from other shooters some more, there are 4 core mechanics that would be included:&#x200B;**Team Captain**One player in each team gets to assign its teammates to secondary objectives during the match (e.g. hunt down enemy A, secure a certain part of the map, assist our healer, etc.). Players that complete these secondary objectives will give their team an overrall advantage, whether through bonus score or after-match rewards.&#x200B;**Power Nodes**Throughout each match, special interactive objects would spawn, giving the player who consumes it an upgrade to an ability of their choice. Their spawn rate would favor teams struggling with the primary objective. They'd also be given more frequently to teams that accomplish their Captain's assignments.&#x200B;**Warrior Mods**In the warrior (this game's name for "hero") customization screen, players can choose between 6 specific modifications to their kit and tune their power through 6 mod points. Works identical to Paladins' card system, but in a more streamlined way.&#x200B;**Mobility Stance**Any warrior is capable of entering the Mobility Stance, which disables their weapons and abilities and allow them to traverse the map more efficiently. Think of Emily or Corvo sheathing their swords to run faster in the Dishonored franchise.

Territorial domination/survival as a cat in a quiet sprawling suburb 
Top-down map, like GTA1, but the map is a randomly generated quiet suburb, with streets, gardens, houses etc. You're a cat, who has to stay fed but also you want a big territory. Free food at home but you can climb trees and fences to get out and about. Catch little animals to eat, and fight other cats as you venture into the neighborhood. Watch out for cats in their own garden because they have home advantage. Avoid dogs, cars and sprinklers!
 
A game that uses popularity as a tangible weapon. 
A game that has two modes. One where you have to try and be as popular as possible online and another where the popularity can be used as a weapon and the more popular you become the bigger your weapon will be and the more powerful it will be. I think this could be both a deep and surface level game. The deep one maybe starting off with you and a couple of your friends having to try and survive with tiny daggers but a big well known celebrity comes along and makes you popular. But that leads to internal conflict and many problems arise from the fact that you are now popular.Or it could be a simple game like pewdiepie simulator except with some fighting instead of decorations.
 
A game where you’re in court. But as you are trying to defend yourself, you play out the scenario of the crime. 
This might already exist. And honestly I hope it does. I imagine a telltale style game, where your actions, words, etcetera have consequences. It starts with the court hearing of a really heinous crime, and your character on trial. And as the events are told to the judge and jury, it takes you “back” to what happened through sort of a narration/retelling. From the very beginning on all the way to your arrest and into the courtroom, you have to work and make the right decisions to try come out as innocent. All your actions have consequences. You have to figure out your way around witnesses- who sees what, what to say to them, how to avoid, confront, or deal with them. Will you be honest with family and friends? Try to get them on your side, to work out an alibi? You have to deal with possible evidence, either leaving or taking it as needed, looking at or looking away from security cameras. Perhaps assuring you destroy fingerprints- unless they are in locations that might be beneficial... And when you are arrested, how do you deal with your interrogation? If you lie, they might pick up on that. And what you have on you at the time could make or break your chances... How you work through the game changes how your hearing goes. It goes back to the hearing after certain decisions, cementing them in place with evidence, footage, and witness reports. Whether you are guilty as can be, or truly innocent- you are trying to come out free. There could be multiple games in a series, different crimes. Murder, gang violence, drugs,... I would honestly play them all ten times over.
 
Open-world Robin Hood game 
For a while now I've thought that the Robin Hood legend deserves to be captured in the form of a big open-world game with a variety of activities. The spirit of the legend- the mishmash of social interactions, combat, stealth, and supply management, and the episodic character of the stories- seems to lend itself to a particular sort of gameplay style, and I want to outline how I think that might be captured effectively. Essentially I want to feel like I'm playing in the world of [Howard Pyle's Robin Hood legend,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood) but with the freedom to make up the story as I go along.For now let's imagine this game presented in first-person 3D like Elder Scrolls, although the general concept could be adapted to other presentation formats. High-quality graphics are probably not necessary, but a long draw distance would be nice.You start out playing as Robin Hood, at the great [Greenwood Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Oak) in Sherwood Forest. The story is that you've just been betrayed and outlawed by the Sheriff of Nottingham and have had to escape to the forest to survive (there could be a brief cutscene to introduce this story). Under the Greenwood Tree is your camp, which initially just consists of perhaps a straw bed and a single chest of supplies.The core gameplay takes place across day/night cycles. At the start of each day you spawn in the camp under the Greenwood Tree and from there you can wander across the map in whatever direction. You can pick up weapons (typically a longbow, sword or staff), an outfit, and other such supplies at the camp and carry them with you. Supplies at the camp persist from one day to the next.I'm imagining the map as being procedurally generated for every playthrough, partly because I'm a big fan of PCG, partly because I think it would be more interesting and immersive if you have to figure out your own strategies rather than relying on rote strategies discovered by other players, and partly because the concept requires a fairly large map, at least a few kilometers across, with a lot of 'filler'. (If the map is procedurally generated, the player could be given options for just how big to make it.) In any case, the map wraps on itself on all four sides, so although it is finite there are no borders to block the player; this seems like a good way to capture the microcosm of the Robin Hood legend without making the player feel constrained.The map has various areas, always including Sherwood Forest (a fairly large and relatively uninhabited region of deciduous forest, with the Greenwood Tree somewhere deep within it), the town of Nottingham, and some areas of farmland. Sherwood Forest always has at least one road and at least one stream running through it somewhere, and there is always at least one church. If the map is procedurally generated, larger maps could be populated with other distinct forests and towns, more complicated road networks, possibly small lakes, moorlands, extra castles or tower forts, ruins, megaliths, etc.Unlike game with fixed day-night cycles, the advancement of time is governed dynamically by the player's actions. Morning lasts for some time after leaving the camp, then advances into midday as the player ventures further from Sherwood Forest or engages in other activities like hunting or robbery. Eventually, as the player returns to Sherwood Forest some time after midday, the time automatically advances into evening.There are various activities the player can engage in across the map, such as hunting in the forest, ambushing caravans on the roads, or going into the towns for socialization, shopping, pickpocketing, fights etc. In the spirit of the legends, the use of outfits is integral to these activities: Wearing your Lincoln green suit makes you instantly recognizable to the Sheriff's guards, but reduces enemies' ability to track you and aim at you in the forest; whereas civilian clothing makes you less likely to be noticed, but provides little combat advantage; and armor deflects attacks but slows down your movements and makes your aim worse. You can store different outfits at your camp, and also trade for outfits with random civilians.Also key to the game would be the team-building aspect. You can talk to people you meet and the dialogue options let you reveal your identity and invite them to join your band. (Of course if you try this in town, the NPC might disagree and then call for guards, prompting you to flee the scene.) In the spirit of the legends, a variety of scenarios can lead to this option, such as [fighting with a traveler who is then impressed with your skill,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_and_Little_John) or meeting a soldier who is fed up with his job, etc. If they agree to join, they become one of your Merry Men. (Although female NPCs are also available, allowing you to gather an entire band of Merry Amazons if you like.) Between the end of a day and the start of the next, there is a menu where you can select various tasks for each of your Merry Men to carry out (again, things like hunting, pickpocketing, ambushing caravans, training their skills in the camp, etc). You can select any one of them to play as yourself, so rather than always playing as Robin you can switch to someone else and take them on an adventure instead. You can also instruct some Merry Men to follow you on the next day's adventure, giving you a combat advantage of numbers at the expense of stealth. Additionally if you go to the areas where you instructed your Merry Men to go for their tasks, you can run into them during the day, and even change their instructions as a dialog option; they'll also help you out if they find you in the middle of a fight.Each character in the band has various skills, initially determined by their occupation, but can gain skill as they work with your band, becoming more effective thieves/fighters/etc over time. Playing a character tends to increase their skills faster, so you would tend to play the characters you want to train the fastest. The inter-day menu also shows the supplies available in your camp, and you have to maintain supplies of food, drink, medicine, etc to sustain the well-being of your band and keep people from abandoning you. Random food spoilage or theft from your supplies would influence your decisions about how to assign activities on following days.Fights are mostly characterized as nonlethal, with 'knockouts' or 'injuries' taking the place of death. If your character is captured by guards (or if any other merry man happens to be captured during their daily activities), they are taken to a prison and a date, several days out, is fixed for their execution. During that time you can play as one of the other Merry Men and try to break into the prison and free your bandmates, or bribe guards to free them, or use the inter-day menu to assign your bandmates the activity of attempting a prison break- all with the risk that *more* Merry Men might also be captured and imprisoned in the process. The game is only over if the entire band is captured, or if Robin is executed.Your popularity with various factions depends on your activities. If you send your bandmates to distribute food or money to the poor, your popularity with poor civilians goes up and they are less likely to report you and more likely to join your band or randomly help out during a fight. You can also donate to churches, bribe guards, etc to manipulate the opinions of various NPC groups with corresponding effects on how they react to you and your bandmates during play. The game could randomly generate various mini-quests, such as finding lost livestock, participating in an archery tournament, or breaking someone important out of jail, as further opportunities to collect loot and/or influence public opinion.The endgame consists of killing the Sheriff himself. There would be no time limit on when to do this, but the Sheriff would be a very strong enemy, and the difficulty of breaking into his castle past all the guards and defenses would tend to require a large, well-trained band, and therefore usually can't be undertaken until after spending some time building up the appropriate resources. (Failed attempts would tend to result in many Merry Men being captured, necessitating a large-scale prison break to save them.)Note that the Sheriff and Robin are the *only* two fixed characters; other than that, the game generates random NPCs with random names, so your band tends to be different every time. Other than the Sheriff and the band, NPCs are not preserved over time, so even NPCs occupying specific roles (e.g. the baker in a specific bakery in Nottingham) are generic, and generated fresh every time you approach that area.I think this accounts for the core of my idea, although it still doesn't touch on a variety of minor features that could potentially be included for extra variety and immersion. For instance: You can fish in streams/lakes for extra food; you can gather wild plants for food/medicine; you can craft certain items, such as staves out of wood or outfits out of cloth, with the right tools; injured Merry Men might have to spend a few days recuperating in the camp, with an impact on the management aspect of the game; male and female bandmates can fall in love and marry (requiring the presence of a priest, of course), improving the band's morale and resilience to hardship; and hunting could even interact with wild animal populations, making it more difficult to find animals if you've recently hunted a lot in that area. I'm sure there are other possibilities as well. The overall idea of the game is to provide enough options and interactions that each day's adventure tends to go a different way, so that the player feels like they're playing through a dynamic story rather than just grinding the same activity repeatedly.

Creation Myth Game Idea? 
We have that project in religious education where everyone is supposed to do something related to a creation myth of our choice. So, because I was working on a simple game engine kind of thing I thought making a game with it would be different and cool. Unfortunately, my application is barely able to load textured objects and display text at the time, so I need something really simple.Anyway, the creation myth I have chosen is the Cherokee Creation Myth. In summary, it is about a heaven made out of stone where the animals lived. Beneath the heaven there is a giant ocean and the earth floating on it. The earth is just flat plate until a bird flew over it, forming mountains with its wings, and hooked up to the stones above with four ropes. It is said that he animals have brought it up from the ocean ground because there was not enough space in heaven.I hope someone has an idea describing how I could present this in a simple game. :)
 
Pixel horror game about feeding the monster in your basement. 
Like little pet shop of horrors, but without the singing. A pixelated horror game in the style of old PS1 games. A man feeds innocent people to a monster in his basement because it promises to bring his wife back when it's fully grown.The main gameplay loop would be going out into town to find people to feed to the monster in your basement that night. As the nights went on, people would start to notice the string of disappearances and become more wary, forcing your character to kidnap people he would have let live before, such as women, friendly neighbors, and even his own family. The final scene would have him be eaten by the monster, whether it be against his will, to avoid capture, or as the final sacrifice to bring his wife back. It would probably follow your character over the course of 1-2 weeks, during which the monster would grow from a medium-ish creature to something grotesque and hulking.Sorry if this is weird lol, I've been binging horror movies in quarantine lmao.
 
Just A Totally Legitimate Question 
So I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I absolutely love the idea, this gives people the ability to express their creativity without having to go through the process of making the games themselves.However, I do have a question about the people picking up these ideas.Are you guys/gals picking up the person along with the idea?, or just taking the idea itself and forgetting who came up with it? I have a ton of ideas I could share here and will probably be doing so in the future for other people to possibly use, but there are a couple of ideas I would love to be a part of the development of them.I understand just taking the idea itself if the creator has nothing to truly offer in development, other than being there, but what if they have some skills, just not enough to do it themselves? Me personally, I'm a creative writer and plan on learning some c# soon so I could help with both storyline/dialogue and hopefully some of the scripting eventually.Just some thoughts I had, what do you think? Should the creator of the idea be a part of the development of it? Or do you think posting in this sub relieves them of all rights to the idea?
 
Overcooked-style hoard game 
Basically, you are in a kitchen with a time limit to bake/cook something, what ever you can make you use as a weapon against hoards of enemies.Example:You could make a baguette and use it as a sword.You could make spaghetti and use it as a whip.You could make soup and scald the enemies, giving DPS damage.etc, etc.I might try develop it as a game, but I first want to know if it's an alright idea.
 
Who farted? 
A multiplayer game about farting.In a setting with multiple people on a map, one guy is randomly selected as the "farter".He has to find a good place on the map to fart. His objective is to spread the fart cloud and make it as big as possible through some yet-to-be decided mechanics.The other players have to do missions to help contain the spreading fart cloud before it grows into a global pandemic and can't be contained any longer. Each round the players get to vote on who they suspect the farter to be.The player with the most votes (farter or not) will be shot into the sun.If the fart evolves into a global pandemic, the farter wins. If it can be contained, the other players win.

Request to have a "mechanic" flair for posts on this subreddit 
I sometimes get ideas for a gimmick or mechanic that doesn't work as a game in it's own right, but still want feedback on them. I feel like if this niche was big enough it could be its own separate subreddit, but I also don't think the discussion of individual mechanics is so far removed from r/gameideas' core ideals that it would feel out of place on this subreddit.&#x200B;I think adding a "mechanic" tag would encourage discussion on this topic by showing that it's an option for discussion. Whether or not that would be beneficial to r/gameideas is a decision better left to the mods and community on this subreddit, I'm just putting my two cents in.

At the end of February 2016, I started planning my game,>a game in which you move to Japan to study abroad and learn Japanese. You can also travel around the country to explore the country and learn more about its history and culture. The art style is probably going to be in a 3D low poly style because that's what I have the most experience with... For the travelling and to decorate your appartment, you will need money which you can earn inside of the game. (Maybe small multiplayer ellement so friends can explore Japan together). Kind of like a RPG. :pThat's the main idea for my Japanese Language learning game. I actually wanted to start making it some day's ago, but whilst stitching together all ideas that I've had drawn out so far ...  I ran into a major issue as many people probably have when designing a game,**it's boring**... I can't come up with any ideas for the game to be more fun, interesting, and more engaging so people will want to keep playing. So my questions:* How can I make it more fun, interesting, and engaging?* How can I make the language learning aspect of the game to be more enjoyable, effective?* How to add some fun?   \^\^"* What would you like to see in a Japanese Language learning game?So far everything has just been written down on paper, without making anything yet, and I only imagined every piece by piece separately, but when I finally stitched all the ideas together, I realized that it feels kind of boring and empty. Just walking from location to location seems kind of troublesome after some time. Not having enough interaction and being very repetitive (School, game, travel, repeat. Basically what you would do when you really study abroad. It's fun in real life, but in a game, where most people can press the exit button very easily ... yeah not that great of an idea I guess \^\^").I still love the idea a lot, being able to explore Japan whilst learning Japanese, and it would be awesome to make it into a really enjoyable, fun, and useful game to learn Japanese, but I'm feeling very insecure right about now as I can't come up with any solutions. :cAnother issue I started thinking about, what about having a lot of NPC's running around, but even with very easily customizable characters ... to write a couple of **100** different stories that NPC's can talk about will be a huge time consumer I guess \^\^"I know about this other game called *Koe* but the way Japanese is being thought isn't one of my favorites, I want people to actually be able to reach somewhat of an *almost* fluent level using my game \^\^" Sadly, there aren't that many language learning games which I can use as inspiration, but that's also another reason why I want to make this game into a reality. XPIs this a sign that it's a bad game idea and that I should just give up and try something else or?
 
Man-eating Lightning McQueen Fake Taxi Simulator (serious) 
It's a working title.    The game would probably be a mod for the GTA1 engine, or something similar.    You are an anthropomorphic car, lightning McQueen style, and you have a taste for human flesh (you are the only one of your kind). You pose as a taxi, and lure in unsuspecting customers, then kill and eat them. If they become suspicious or you fail to lead them to their destination, they will become suspicious and try to leave the taxi. However, you must also avoid being detected by the public and police. The police become aware that some kind of serial killer is afoot, and ramp up security and make your life difficult. You do not need to kill every passenger, but you risk starving to death over time.    Things become more difficult over time as the police crack down to find the culprit. Methods of killing your customers are taken away, and the player has to rely on creative strategies like getting into crashes or other environmental kills and/or tailor the murder to the victim, i.e distractedness, couple or one person, etc. Managing your vehicle and upgrading it and so on could add to complexity. Ofc this sort of thing would come into play later in development.
 
Old PCs experience VR 
The idea is a VR software that simulates you ..the physical player...sitting on an old PC like back in the..80s...90s..00s...whatever...and let you play popular games from that area. The whole room you sit in also looks like from this area.So you put on your VR set...and see yourself sitting in a room that could be from your childhood back in 1994..with posters from that time...outside the window you see cars driving by from that area...mabye even an old radio playing shows from that time..and in the middle your old 1994 monitor that plays DOOM1 in a forced 320x240 resolution, with dust stains on the  old glass screen, dity white keyboard and a superold PC without CD drive...you know what I meanlol

Breaking the Fourth Wall 
I always liked this idea for a game...it's based on all of the bugs and crazy stuff that happens in a game that pulls people out of the experience. It would also incorporate elements similar to how Metal Gear used to break the 4th wall all the time.The game starts like many others, perhaps it begins in a Skyrim type setting or a run of the mill third person adventure RPG.Slowly, as the game progresses...you, the player, begin to notice strange things. Characters begin to glitch, subtly. Things like their dialog doesn't match the subtitles. Things become more strange as you progress. In game characters stop looking at your third person avatar. They start to look directly at the camera. They start to look directly at you, the player. At first you can't tell if it's a glitch, or not...they'll look at you for a brief moment, then snap back to their scheduled programming.Suddenly, a character stops addressing your character. They look to you, the player and address you directly. "Help us." Anyways, the game would then slowly but surely break down into a race to save the trapped in game inhabitants by initiating quests where you purposely find ways to break the game. You're purposely asked to use debug modes, break game behaviors and set the inhabitants free. I always thought that would be a great mind-twist game. I love the way the MGS games broke through those barriers, imagine an entire game dedicated to breaking that 4th wall.
 
It's just cosmetic 
Following the latest craze of games with lootboxes selling you the odds of getting cosmetic items I thought of a small parody game, made in maybe Unity or something similar.    You play a generic team/hero shooter, the levels and models are basic to say the least, untextured, gray blocky with just a hint of what it could resemble.    You have a the standard ingame currency you earn through playing and you have a random "real life" currency each time you install the game.    The game basically encourages to buy/earn as much lootboxes as possible to cosmetically upgrade the game.    The lootboxes drop textures/skins an better looking models for players and for the environment, the longer you play the game, the better you can make it look, "It's just cosmetic"    inspired by the Jimquisition rant
 
Platformer in which the world around you moves only when you are grounded" Can anyone convince me this could be fun? 
I posted this mechanic the other day and I must have deleted it by mistake.  Many people liked it:  >When you are in the air, all NPCs' animation are suddenly frozen at the current frame as well as any projectiles.  >  >You  can jump, dash, hang from the platform above. All those count as being  "in the air" and they cost stamina, which gets replenished whenever you  touch the ground.  >  >Any additional  ideas or variations you can think of? What do you think about the world  freezing when you are in the air? Would it be better for it to freeze  when on the ground instead?&#x200B;I thought it was a good one too. But after a second thought and making a quick prototype trying to see if it was fun... I realized it wasn't. When you're grounded everything moves and when you're in the air everything freezes?  Meh...  I originally thought this for a fast-paced platformer, that could involve shooting or not, but fast-paced.  But now that I think about it, it'd be more suitable for a slow puzzlish platformer, and not fun.  Can anyone convince me otherwise?
 
Mechanics for a prison fight game? 
I'm creating a top-down 1 versus 1 fighting game set in a kind of prison shower area, like Warzone's gulag. There's a lot of hard angles, you can't see over the walls, and you can place traps and temporary walls for the other player to fall in while looking for you. The only problem is, the combat just feels bland, y'know? | just hit them until they die. What potential mechanics would fit with this theme? I've looked at a lot of fight videos, and there's a lot of pulling and shoving involved which could play well. Any ideas?
 
Questgiver - the real hero is the NPC! 
You play the role of a normal NPC in a High Fantasy setting, in a city hub that receives a lot of visits from heroes. You're a Questgiver, and as such, your responsibilities are huge - for all heroes have a problem:They will accept any quest given to them!But not every hero has the same karma, reputations, affiliations and personalities - and these will influence the world around you, so be careful to give the right quests to the right heroes!--------So the gameplay is basically just "associate quests to the right heroes"The town/world would have certains needs (wealth, culture, security, TBD) and sending certain heroes to certain quests will affect those needs. Heroes would have different attributes (Level, Karma, Reputation, Guild Affiliation, Personalities, Class, Race, TBD) that would influence the outcome of the quests, and as thus influence the needs of the town.In terms of gameplay design/mechanic I'm thinking either simple:* Card gameYou get a random selection of heroes as cards, the ones you play influence the meters, you must learn to play the right cards to keep the meters [balanced or filled, TBD] - see: [Nirvana - Game of Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=goldtusks.doron.nirvana)* Management/tycoon game The size of the Inn determines the number of heroes that can visit the town, you get to send them on quests but they take time to be done (the higher the hero's LVL, faster the quest done, etc). Town upgrades through the results of quests. See: [This Is The Police](https://store.steampowered.com/app/443810/This_Is_the_Police/)Or more complex: * Civilization gameA bit like management/tycoon, but the core crux of the game design would be less on  the "surviving" aspect of management and more on building a distinctive "evolution tree" based on certain principles (what type of town/world you want). Try and find the right combinations of heroes and quests to either make an evil barbaric god-worshiping war-mongers Elven civilization, an highly-educated Orc technological utopia, a dragon-hunters Dwarf dictatorship, a multicultural hub based on arts and magics, etc. --------I have a lot of ideas depending on whichever versions I'm focusing at, but I thought that was a neat concept that wasn't explored enough in my opinion. I'd love to hear your thoughts! 
 
A racing game where you can accelerate near instantly and as much as you want but takes unusually long to slow down and theres hard to dodge obstacles that make you regret accelerating seconds ago 
 
A racing game turns into a creepy driving game as you explore the desolate world outside of the race course. 
This is a creepy experimental game, emulating how [some low budget racing games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1zWEhgrLs) let you exit the race area and explore the empty landscape outside. Except this is done with a more oppressive tone and hints of a sinister story.****The game would start like a standard racing game set within a city (like Project Gotham Racing) but after the race ends, the player isn't booted out of the area to the next race. Instead the music fades away and other racecars vanish one by one like they're being unloaded from RAM.The player is meant to think the game bugged out. After they find a way to exit the racetrack, they'd be allowed to explore the surrounding city backdrop. The further out they go, the lower textures are on everything. Some buildings don't even have backsides.But there's some weird traces in the game world. You might come across tire track donuts in some parking lot. There's an abandoned racecar. And there's a gas station which slowly fills up your gas tank just by staying near the pumps (you'd only notice if you change the camera view to the car's interior and look at the gauges on the dash).Then the player might come across a *wrecked* racecar. The driver side door is bused off its hinges and there is blood on the ground, but there's nobody inside.It's after this point that the game procedurally trigger an event in which the player would notice headlights in the far distance. There's someone else here.
 
You're an evil villain and by God you will monologue if it means the death of you! 
I dreamt this idea and I know it's kind of stupid but it's just meant to be a comical game that you wouldn't necessarily invest a lot of time in.The idea is that you're a supervillain and you must maintain the supervillain tropes or be laughed at by your counterparts. Sure you could easily kill the superhero with one shot to the head, but they won't die knowing your super evil plot!I imagine gameplay is something like, you have the superhero captured and you begin your monologue, maybe some dialogue cues are presented, but while you're doing this, you are also walking around the room checking to make sure the superhero is not planning an escape. Did they loosen the ropes their hands are tied in? Is their sidekick in the vents? Did they use their telekinetic powers to open the draw that contains the key to their shackles?I'm assuming there would be a point system based on time or something like that.I also thought you could have other stupid villain tropes, like you have to purposefully miss the superhero while shooting at them down the hallway, but they're so damn slow sometimes it's hard not to!I've only played it once (so this could be off the mark) but I imagined a 3rd person 5 nights at Freddy's type game play.Also, I can't believe there is a 'dream' flair lmao
 
Game where the soundtrack affects the gameplay 
Okay so I thought it would be cool to create a main character who has the ability to manipulate the game, specifically the soundtrack. There would be pickups and abilities that allowed you to change the genre of music which strengthens certain weapons and abilities and the volume of the music which increases all overall stats. Things like lente would slow the music and time down and vice versa for tempo pick ups. For bosses they get their own theme which weakens youand by destroying key parts of them this weakens them and your theme starts to be heard. You get skill trees that upgrade your proficiency with different genres and grant added effects to the weapons they buff.
 
Fallout but ice age 
I didn't know how to say it with a few words, but, the world has gone through another ice age, humanity was barely able to survive it and now people live in domes with heating and only leave when they search for resources.The gameplay is the same as the first two fallout games but with the addition of temperature management.
 
Open world, online Cops and Criminals 
Play in massive lobbies in an open world set within urban and suburban map. Play with friends that can vary on what role you choose. 2 cops per patrol car, and 4 per car as criminals.As the cops, youre given a basic loadout of non-lethal choices, a shotgun in the vehicle, a handgun with 3 magazines total, body armor and a patrol car. You respond to crimes committed by other players and ai generated crimes as well that can range from petty robbery, muggings, car jackings to full blown bank robberies and hostage situations. Cops will be discouraged from harming innocents and doing grossly in competent, police like activities such as driving on sidewalks needlessly, shooting civilians, ect. Doing so will get the player labeled as a rogue cop and all other cop players will receive a bonus for bringing them in or taking them down.As criminals, you have free reign to do as you please and weaponsand body armor can be used as found or bought. Your only real objective is dont get arrested/killed while you live the criminal life style. Safehouses will be available to customize character, save vehicles and weapons, or sell drugs supplied by an ai controlled supplier. Lobbies will have a 3 to 1 ratio of criminal to cop players. Small time crimes will have a smaller radius in which the call goes out to nearest cop players, while large scale crimes will go out across the map. The more heinous the crime, the more resources the cops will have available to respond (SWAT gear, dogs, ect).
 
A game where you play as a caveman who find the Dino-killing meteor and gets powers 
Your a caveman and your family has  been kidnapped. You find this bigass meteor. You touch it and bam you get Dino powers. You can turn into a pterodactyl, t-rex, longneck and mosasoraus. It’s a 3D platformer. Start the game in a big tropical jungle, and as you progress you see more and more humans who give side quests and shops and items. Mid game maybe you find a collection of tribes in a cave system. And late game you end in a big Mesopotamia like city.
 
Ridiculous gun fps 
So a game similar to halo, with team death match or free for all, and there is different guns littered all around the map. But.....the guns are completely bonkers and obsurd:Pew pew banana - fires weak lasers then drops a peel any player can trip on when reloaded. (Starting gun?)Disco laser - has a disco ball on the end of it that just fires lasers in every direction.Chicken grenade - throw a chicken, then the chicken randomly poops out grenades.Don't reload me mg - A machine gun with a 25 second reload animation that cant be undone.Glitch gun - Everytime you reload it shoots differently.Splash blaster - only deals splash damage, so hit something next to your target.Wonder nades - grenades with a random fuse time ranging from 1 second - 2 minutes.Other ideas?
 
RPG/Action/Adventure video game idea that I always have thought, dreamed and pondered for a decade. 
So, this is weird to say, but this idea started as a dream in my teenage years, when I still have time to play very long story-based RPGs like Dragon Age: Origins and Baldur's Gate. I have dreamt of this sporadically over a decade, I even tried to write a whole backstory that was eventually lost to a failed hard drive. I am hoping that someone can pick this idea here.So the backstory, a story about a relatively forested continent (like Ancient Germania) filled with magical creatures but primarily ruled by two separate nations at relative peace, elves and dwarves. Elves ruled most of the forested lowlands, druidic in nature but also build vast forested cities, like the the Germanic barbarians in our time, only that these elves are not migratory, but sedentary. Dwarves ruled most of the hilly and mountainous highlands, being experts in carving and taming the earth. Other creatures like nomadic centaurs, fauns, dragons, both tamed and wild, also exists both in conjunction with the elven and dwarf states. Some are living in proto-states like tribes and city states, though not as widely encompassing as the elves and dwarves. Think tribal/migratory/city-state Europe before Rome. Also both knew primitive forms of magic, elves in commune with nature, dwarves with earth, rock and metal.I know, a little bit cliched, but bear with me, I am only around 17-18 at the time.Then in the desert coast at the south came a few black ships spewing black smoke, carrying humans from another continent. These humans are never-before seen in the continent, both in legends and myths, so all the other races are baffled. Through magic, the humans explained that they are an industrialized society where magic is rudimentary but never properly honed, where industry surpassed it. The continent that they have been from was destroyed from an unknown catastrophe, and they were the only ones left. Others have purposely been left behind due to the lack of ships and fuel for the journey. They have been at sea for years. Few precious cargo and factory components were salvaged, as the ships they were on bore survivors, food and water, but little others.So, pitying these several hundred humans, the elves and dwarves let them settle on a small coast in the deserts, trading with them to help them survive. They are also in awe of what the humans say about industrialization, but never took it for themselves for they are already self-sufficient. So decades passed and the humans grew more numerous. Industries flourished, and while both elves and dwarves abhor the consumption of nature by the human industry, they are actually benefiting from the trade with the humans. Soon elves and dwarves also adopted some of the technological marvels, albeit very slowly, and also attempting to meld their magic with the human tools.However, tensions rise as the resources the humans need to grow dwindled, as they were also given just a stretch of the arid southern continent as their territory. Through favorable treaties with the elves and dwarves, soon the humans start pushing north towards the sacred forests of the elves and the hills of the dwarves. The elves soon wise up, and eventually forbid the humans from expanding their territory. The dwarves however, still are willing to trade with the humans due to the industrial potential it possesses.For several years this has continued, with the humans continuously negotiating with the elves and the dwarves for integration with their societies and access to bountiful resources, and the latter factions trying to ~~obligate~~ placate the humans through trade instead, which of course is not enough for the human industry to be reborn.A great tension happened when a son of the human ambassador to the elves is revealed to be the father of the unborn son of the elven princess. Though inbreeding already happened between the other races in secret, it is highly sacrilegious to elven laws, and since the half-blooded prince will also be the heir to the throne, this puts the elven court and its high-king in a dilemma. Their future rule will be jeopardized by human influence due to the heir's father. As such, the human ambassador~~ is put in chains,~~ and the elven daughter will be put to death along with the unborn heir, which is also disinherited. Though fortunately the son escapes to the human kingdom due to elven sympathizers. War started when the human city states demanded the return of the half-elven prince. This is also political in nature as the possession of the prince potentially will allow them leeway in the elven court, and in turn, more resources. Elves declared war as well, and goaded the dwarven state to do so. The latter said no, but the human city states grew very greedy, and citing the decline of trade and broken contracts with the dwarven-elven mines, declared war on them as well.By now, let's say that the humans were at the early stages of industrialization, and the elves and dwarves are at Roman levels of civilization. The 'ancient' races were pushed back again and again due to superior human firearms and artillery, as well as more efficient human tactics vs the overwhelming numbers of the others. However, with the halt of trade and lack of general resources, the human industry begins to falter. Lack of manpower contributes as well. The conflict devolves into a stalemate as neither the humans can defeat numbers nor the ancients can defeat technological superiority.A breakthrough eventually happens as the elves and dwarves began to use rituals to form metal/rock/nature binded golems powered through half-human souls. Though this is abhorring to the eyes of the few, most of the elves and dwarves eventually hated humans, even half-blooded ones, due to propaganda. Many are willing to turn in neighbors to be converted to golems, while sympathizers are eventually executed. The tide turns as the golems are fiercely loyal to their creators and are totally impervious to human weapons, and because the human industry halts due to lack of resources. They are eventually pushed back to one city state, desperate for survival. Eventually it falls, and the humans went back to their almost initial numbers when they first came back to the continent. Pitying the humans, the elves and dwarves offered the remaining humans to set sail with whatever ships they have, never to return again.The son of the human ambassador to the elves survived, leading the survivors to the unknown. The half-elven prince and the princess' fate is unknown. The half-human golems were eventually sealed in the last human city which is also eventually razed, as a testament to the countless lives ended by the conflict. Surviving half-human settlements eventually integrated with the ancient races, the racism and prejudice watered away by the departure of original humans.Human cities were razed, but artifacts and books were eventually codified and stored as part of history. Centuries passed and the civilizations in the continent progressed to medieval times using human codexes and books, though more slowly than the ancient humans. Human ruins are being scoured by scholars for more knowledge.In a human ruin, an elven scholar accidentally reactivates the last intact half-human golem and releases it from its elven bondage. Prejudiced due to his/her last memories being of torture, the golem murders the scholar, and fueled by a voice asking him to render the humans service one last time, embarks in a journey.So backstory ended, let's get to the mechanics.This is an RPG/Action/Adventure game, with a rich backstory but a very linear path. Think Dark Souls or Blasphemous. You are a golem, a suit of armor to be exact. Your story is to journey to whatever the voice in your head tells you to do, all the while interacting with other people along the way. You can make allies along the way which will help you in your quest, but also enemies due to the fact that you are a released half-human golem that elven and dwarven authorities may think is on a path of rampage (according to their history codexes).The first half of the game is a cliche. You have a main quest, side quests, inventory. Though because you are a suit of armor, your body will chink away every time you are damaged. Once say for example your legs has been whittled by enemies, you have little choice but to repair it through patchwork, mending it with different armor pieces/scrap metals. The only way you can 'heal completely' is to find ancient dwarven runestones, which can also upgrade your armor. Elven runestones however bestow you powers like a shield every minute or so. I am not good at game mechanics, so please help me here.Eventually, you get to your destination. You find the ancient elven princess in a time stasis with the ancient half-human/elf baby prince. She's been communicating to you as you are the last half-human golem from the war, a relic of the bygone age. She tells you that as the centuries passed, magic has been 'leaving' the world due to advancements in technology (which is why the ancient humans possesses so little of it), her power is waning, and she needs you to bring the child to the human ruin that you came from at all cost. She lifts the stasis, gives you the baby, then dies. You bury her, then the game eventually goes from 'childy' to 'dark soulsy'. Now here, the last half of the game, the game mechanics gets tricky. To be able to transport the child safely, you need to put him in your armor. The elven princess bestowed you with a new spell that puts the baby in time stasis, impervious to any harm, as long as it is in you, the armor. So you need to back where you come from. The path back becomes more dangerous as the elven and dwarven authorities find out what you are doing, and eventually sets upon all those who helped you in your path, and doubles their efforts to destroy you and the baby. Much worse, you must take care not to let the baby die at all cost. If you chink out too many parts of your body, then the baby will take damage. Think of the Rot mechanic in Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Only that this leads to a game over once the baby takes enough damage.At the end, if you survive, you go back to the city ruins, and eventually encounter an armored blimp, out from which comes a human scout, a descendant of the ~~original~~ son of the human ambassador to the elves, direct ~~descendant~~ kin of the baby you are carrying (through his father), who kills you because he thought you are one of the elven/dwarven weapons from the his history books. He looks at the half-elf/human ancient prince, then roll credits.What do you think of this story for a video game? I actually see it as a 2d sidescrolling game like Blasphemous or so, but please, lay on the criticisms/reactions.EDIT 1: Some proofreading.
 
You are kidnapped by faeries and forced to cook for them 
It's like a cooking simulator/psychological horror game, because they'll kill you if you mess up. Maybe you have to esape somehow? Convince them to let you go? You could do like, fantasy cooking stuff where you use ingredients like starlight and bad dreams.
 
A platformer that purposely and ironically doesn't use common mechanics (like jumping). 
So basically the whole game would be written as sort of a comedic satire of trope mechanics in platformers, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and criticizing the player and developers.I imagine a tutorial where the player character gets to the first obstacle which is like a comedically low wall, and realizes that he does not have the ability to jump, breaks the fourth wall and says something to the effect of "Who the duck doesn't know how to jump". The rest of the game would be sort of like puzzles where you have to figure out how to progress through seemingly simple platforming scenarios where you use object and mechanisms to push, pull, throw you where you need to go. You could even break the fourth wall and use things like the window size or mouse cursor as game mechanics. All the while the player character mouthing off jokes at the ridiculous nature of it all.At the end of the game you would finally get the ability to jump but wouldn't be able to use it because the game is over. or maybe you could backtrack and see how hilariously easy the game is with the ability to jump.
 
A Lofi videogame 
I'm planning on creating a videogame with cool environments like those on my artstation([https://www.artstation.com/littlefoxy](https://www.artstation.com/littlefoxy)) but with maybe lofi music in the background or lofi vibes, does someone has an idea?
 
Ideas for "different" kind of hack and slash game? 
(Sorry If I have wrong flair, idk which one fits most)So basically:I am brainstorming a hack and slash game, which has slower pace than most other hack and slash games and instead has more... Stradegical approach.(Basically think something along lines of Minecraft Dungeons)However, I cant seem to come up with any unique mechanics for my game, so that is why am asking for help!
 
A classic resident evil style game with magic and familiars instead of guns 
So i was thinking of exorcisms and that got me thinking of a game where you go to a mansion to remove demons from there with magical familiars with the controls and mechanics of the classic resident evil games
 
Not a video game, but I guarantee this is the hardest shit you'll ever play 
I call it... Brick Tag!&#x200B;Requirements:\-One Brick\-A group of friends\-A cellphone or other device with a timer\-Snap Maps&#x200B;Instructions:1. Make sure all of the players are visible on Snap Maps2. Decide who is the first one to be “it”3. Synchronize a timer for 8 hours on each of the players’ phones or other devices4. Give whoever’s “it” the brick and have them countdown from five minutes before pursuing the other players&#x200B;Rules:\-Cars and other vehicles are allowed\-Whoever’s “it” is the person who last touched the brick\-“It” can tag the other players by throwing the brick at them\-If the brick makes contact with the player, they are now “it”\-Players must keep themselves visible on Snap Maps at all times\-There are no boundaries, hence why Snap Maps is necessary\-Whoever’s “it” at the end of the 8 hours has to pay $50 to every other player&#x200B;House Rules:\-“It” can turn on Ghost Mode in Snap Maps, but they have to turn on visibility again once they tag someone\-Start the game at midnight and end at 8AM (For effect)\-Start the game in the hood
 
The entire game your character is shrinking and the smaller you go, the more the map reveals. Map is a fractal. Goal is to find the route at the "heart of the fractal" to grow big again. 
Just thought of this when I woke up.If you don't go towards a specific place in the amount of time, then you shrink too small leaving you unable to pass and find a opening when the map grows.I would sense that in some parts of the fractal map, it would repeat itself, so you would have to "figure out the puzzle" in order to find a new sequence or pattern. Sort like the ice cap levels in Sonic) I'm not a game dev, but I don't know if this is possible to achieve this sort of thing.
 
What do all of the flairs mean? An explanation 
I feel like I don't see enough explanation for the flairs (Oftentimes, beginner is misused), so here is a quick run down.**Beginner** \- The game idea itself could be created by a single beginner in a couple of days.

A pure survival horror game with limited ammo and a tense, dangerous, slowed down twist on the Dark Souls combat. 
GAMEPLAY CONCEPTI always felt a much slower twist on the Soulsborne combat formula could work extremely well in a true survival horror context. Sure, Bloodborne was a horror game, but it was mostly an action game overall.My idea would be a 3rd person, surreal horror game set in modern times, with a heavy dark narrative, hideous/creative enemies, guns with tight ammo, and slowed down, realistic, punishing melee combat. The game will be pretty linear, pushing the story forward on a rather direct path, but will also have a few areas where the game momentarily opens up into a small open world. There will be two tiny open worlds. One will appear in the first half of the game and the other in the second. These small open world sections will have enemies throughout, along with an occasional npc or two. There will be secret weapons, supplies, secret areas, a few side quests, and other things.Most activities in the open worlds are completely optional. The story will lead you to certain larger buildings, where you will be opening locked doors, solving puzzles, and creating shortcuts in order to progress, keeping the formula of both Soulsborn and old school survival horror games.Any Souls fan knows how perfect it feels to control the character's left and right arms with your left and right hands. It just feels so hands on and right. I believe having a slower more realistic take on the Souls combat style could fit perfectly within a survival horror situation. I want the melee combat against the deformed beasts to feel visceral and heavy. I should be able to feel every swing. It would work amazingly for adding to the immersion.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENEMIES- Enemies (outside of the open worlds), wont respawn. Once enemies are dead, they are gone, unless you die before saving.- But, once an area has been cleared and the player has saved, sometimes an enemy or two will spawn again at random. - Enemies will slowly respawn in the open world sections. - There will be many unique/creative monster types. Nothing obvious or cliche. A few types might be slightly humanoid and holding a knife or axe.- There will be a few bosses throughout the game. - Enemies will have an animation shift when nearly dead. They will begin to look defeated and slow.- All enemies can be killed via melee or gunfire. Gunfire is much safer and more effective than melee. Enemies will pose a serious threat to a player without a gun. Certain enemies will drain your HP within seconds, if handled incorrectly. Melee takes skill and is very unforgiving.- Enemies will not be flooded all over the game. Story, atmosphere and exploration are the main focus, not combat. Im thinking kind of like the spacing of enemies in Silent Hill 2. Not overly action packed, but enough enemies to have to be dealt with at times. - If fighting melee, most enemies have to be learned and taken very seriously like in Dark Souls. There will be many easier enemies throughout the game, but several will be quite a challenge and take a decent amount of skill.- Certain unique, much more dangerous, enemies, will roam around the game at random points. They are extremely tough to take on with melee, but can be killed much easier with a gun.- In most cases, enemies will move at a speed which allows the player's slower movement not to be out matched. There will be a few quicker enemy types scattered throughout the game, but they again, are much easier to take out with a gun.- Basically, melee can either be mastered or mostly avoided. It's pretty much there as a scary last resort, or for people who want the challenge. Using a gun more than evens the playing field for most players who just want to enjoy the story and atmosphere.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------GUNS- A handgun will become available pretty soon into the game, giving some early game relief. A shotgun and a rifle will come later. Nothing automatic. - Ammo is tight but if you choose your shots well, you should manage to scrape by.- Using the gun turns the game into a much more accessible experience. Horror isnt about difficulty, yet having extremely lethal enemies lurking around is panic inducing, even with a gun in your hand. This will force players to take every moment slowly, choose every shot wisely, and just overall play more cautiously. All while not making the game overly difficult. WEAPON DURABILITY - Many melee weapons will break. Their durability will effect their overall power. Certain weapons will break easier on different enemy types. But, something as weak as a knife can also take a long time to break if used on soft enemies.- Many unbreakable melee weapons will be slightly hidden throughout the game. Basically, weapons you wouldnt expect to break, dont break. Early versions of these are easy to find and makes it so the player always has something that can get them through combat. - Many breakable melee weapons may work better against certain enemies, but any unbreakable weapon can get the job done in any situation.- Breakable weapons allow for varied combat, experimentation, optional extra challenge, and fun, without being a nuisance.- The melee weapon list wouldnt be extremely long. Maybe just 10 common, real world weapons/tools/objects, with a few variants.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------SAVING - The game should work on a save point system. Frequent checkpoints destroy tension. - Automatic checkpoints will only show up right before a point of no return, such as a cutscene or bossfight, just so nobody gets screwed. CAMERA- The camera should, for the most part, closely follow the player.- Players will be able to adjust the camera with the right analog stick.- There will be occasional moments of classic fixed camera angles. (Aiming while in fixed angles will use auto aim).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------MAP- Using the map does not pause the game.- The player will find a map for each area they are in.- The map will get marked with stuff like locked doors, puzzle locations, etc.- Custom notes can be written onto the map.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------INVENTORY- Opening the inventory puts the world into a slight slow motion. This will add to the player never feeling fully at ease, while still cutting them a little slack.- Inventory shows player status, weapons, notes, items, etc. There is no limit to inventory but you can only carry one of each weapon. Inventory management shouldn't have to be a pain.- There are two equipable quick access weapon slots. These weapons are switched between in game by a button press. - Incase players are using breakable weapons, each weapon slot has a backup slot where a 2nd weapon can be selected. - Players cannot access these weapons in game until their primary weapon breaks. - Once the first weapon breaks, it takes about two seconds to pull the second weapon out. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------DAMAGE- Enemies inflict brutal damage on the player. The player's arms, legs, head, and torso each individually take damage when struck. Damage to the legs or arms, cause them to be less effective. Damaged arms make melee, blocking and aiming less effective. Injured legs make the player move slower, limp, and have more of a chance of stumbling/falling. - The player has both HP for individual parts (arms, legs, torso, head) and overall player HP.  The overall HP is based off the condition of all body parts.- Damage is shown realistically on the player's body as well as on enemies. Player and enemy attacks leave bloody marks where they strike. - Blood will accumulate on the player's body based on directly getting hit and also a percentage system. - Each body part will have a different amount of bleeding based on its current amount of HP. Each limb will show damage when struck but wounds will barely bleed at higher HP. Once HP gets lower, blood will begin to bleed more and more from the wounds until healed.EDIT: This might be crazy, but what if once the head reaches a low enough HP, the joysticks could switch every once in awhile. Meaning right stick becomes left, left becomes right. It could do it for only a few seconds at a time. Idk. Might be cool. Maybe too much. Just makes head injuries extremely serious and forces players to attend to them quickly.GUAGING PLAYER HEALTH- Exact health can be viewed on the inventory screen.- In game, health can be guaged by looking at the player's condition. Hurt arms and legs will be held differently and blood will be running from their wounds.  - At 50% overall health, a light pulse will be heard.- 25% brings a redness around the edges of the screen and a louder pulse.- 10% - 0% Gradually drains screen of color until its  black and white. The pulse sound will get louder and slow down. Music and certain sound effects will get slightly drowned out.HEALING- Healing is done in real time.- The game will have two healing options; a drink and a Medikit.- You find health scattered around the game.- Healing removes visible blood from the character.HEALTH DRINKS- Drinks heal less than medikits.- Drinks give a small overall boost in HP to all body parts.- Drinking only takes three seconds and the player can quickly walk while doing it.MEDIKITS- When choosing a Medikit, the player has a prompt to be able to choose a specific body part to heal.- Once the body part is chosen, the Medikit heals it 100%.- Medikits also heal every other body part a moderate amount.-  Using a Medikit has animations of sometimes kneeling (depending on body part being healed), pouring peroxide, using medical wrap and cutting with scissors.- Medikits take 10 seconds to apply, but can be briefly interrupted (quick moving, combat), three times before progress is lost.- If healing is not completed, bandages will eventually begin to fall off and progress will be lost. The Medikit will return to your inventory.- Sucessfully applied bandages will remain on the character for about two minutes before they either fall off, or the character is animated pulling them off.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------HUD- There will be a very minimal HUD, if any at all.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------STAMINA- The player doesnt have unlimited stamina. Stamina works like Souls. Goes down when you run, punch, swing weapon, block, dodge, and push. Goes right back up when you stop. Completely drain your stamina and you are slow, weak and ineffective. If stamina is completely drained, it will take two seconds of inactivity before starting to refill.  - There is no on screen guage to keep an eye on, instead the player will begin to breath heavier and heavier as their stamina drains. CONTROLS- The basic controls are very much based around the Dark Souls control scheme, so this will definitely make most sense to Souls fans. The way Fromsoftware set the buttons up, really makes you feel connected to the gameplay, which is very important when creating immersion.Most of this layout isnt too crazy, but the gun control scheme might need a bit of tweeking in certain parts. I really like it, but it might be horrible. Lol.Here's a set up that I think could work pretty well.I picture the player movement being close to the speed of Red Dead 2. Everything has weight and isnt super gamey. Set for a PS4----------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANALOG STICKSLEFT STICK - MOVE CHARACTER- Moves character around. Speed is based on push strength. Speed ranges from a slow walk to a light jog.L3 - FLASHLIGHT ON/OFFRIGHT STICK - CAMERA/AIM/ LOCK ON SWITCH- Adjusts the camera and aims gun.- While locked on, the player can switch between enemies.R3 - CROUCH- Click to crouch/stand.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------/\ (Triangle) - TWO HAND/ONE HAND WEAPON- Switches between holding a melee weapon or gun with one or two hands. - Melee weapons are more powerful when swung with two hands.- Guns, (especially shotguns and rifles), are more accurate with two hands.□ - KICK/STOMP ENEMY- Stomps and kills enemies on the floor.- Kicks away enemies. Kicks dont do any damage on most enemies. They are only used for creating space. It slightly stuns or stumbles enemies for about a second. Just enough time to land a hit, shot, or run.- Kicking an enemy can be countered if done at the wrong time. - Some enemies cannot be staggered by kicks.- Kicks are most effective against shorter enemies.○ - DODGE/RUN- If tapped the player clumsily dodges away from the enemy.- If held, the player runs quickly until all stamina is gone.X - INTERACT/VAULT- Interacts with different prompts around the game.- Climbs up some small ledges.TOUCHPAD- Open/close inventory menu.START BUTTON- Pause game. ----------------------------------------------------------------D-PAD (UP) - MAP- Pulls out a map. Doesnt pause the game.(LEFT) - HEAL- Tap left on the D-Pad to drink a health drink.- Hold left on the D-Pad to choose a Medikit.- Holding left will bring up the Medikit menu, where you can see each body part's HP, and choose which part to heal.(RIGHT) - SWITCH WEAPON- Quickly switched between your two equipped weapons.(DOWN) - NOTE- Player can equip a note for quick access.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------MELEE COMBAT CONTROLS- As said before, melee is learnable but extremely dangerous.------------------------------------------------------------------------------MELEE COMBAT - NO WEAPONNOTE: Fighting without a weapon inflicts next to no damage on most enemies, but is a viable hardcore tactic, like in Souls.L1 - GUARD/LOCK ON- Holding locks on to enemy.- Holding L1 puts the left arm up in a ready position, guarding the player's body and face. The left arm takes reduced damage while blocking. It can sometimes successfully swat away incoming attacks.L2 - PUSH- Left arm pushes enemy back. Push strength is based on how quickly you pull the trigger.- Pushes, when landed, will momentarily stagger enemies, but only for a brief time, (like kicks).- Pushes work best on medium to tall enemies.- Some enemies are unstaggerable. - Pushes can occasionally be countered by enemies, (like kicks).* Same applies to any push mentioned below.R1 - LIGHT PUNCH-  Light right arm punch.R2 - HEAVY PUNCH- Heavy right arm punch. Power based on how fast the trigger is pulled. --------------------------------------------------------------------------MELEE - WEAPON - ONE HANDEDL1 - GUARD/LOCK ON- Lock on to enemy and block with left hand like before.L2 - PUSHR1 - LIGHT ATTACK- Light attack with weapon in right hand.R2 - HEAVY ATTACK- Heavy attack with right hand weapon. Power based on trigger pull speed. -----------------------------------------------------------------MELEE - TWO HAND WEAPONL1 - GUARD/LOCK ON- Guards and deflects with the weapon in two hands. Some weapons are more effective than others. -Locks on to enemy.L2 - PUSH- Push enemy away with both hands on weapon.R1 - LIGHT ATTACK- Light two hand attack.R2 - HEAVY ATTACK- Heavy two hand attack based on trigger pull speed. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------GUN CONTROLSThis is where is gets kinda rocky. I like the controls and feel it makes sense. I might be crazy. The switch in controls for one handed aiming, is intentionally awkward but it might go to far. I'm mainly just sticking to the Dark Souls (left/right), control scheme.  Any real world person, without training, would struggle much more firing a gun with one hand. I'm just trying to convey that.Gun is held in right hand. All guns can be fired with one band. Aiming and accuracy is greatly reduced when one handing a gun, especially with shotguns and rifles.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GUN CONTROLS - ONE HANDEDL1 - GUARD- Guard with left hand.L2 - PUSH- Push with left handR1 - AIM- Holding R1 aims the weapon. The camera pulls in right behind the players shoulder.- A small white dot shows up for the reticle. - The reticle will wobble around more while one handed aiming. R2 - SHOOT----------------------------------------------------------------------------------GUN CONTROLS - TWO HANDL1 - GUARD- Player uses arms and gun to deflect attacks.L2 - AIM- Reticle is pretty steady with a little wobble. R1 - RELOADR2 - SHOOT
 
A game about being the annoying NPC 
I was just thinking how funny it would be to be the one in an escort mission where you're surrounded by much more competent/powerful NPCs who get increasingly annoyed with you. This could be a single mission in a variety of games, but I can see an entire meme game where you try your very best to piss off highly competent NPCs. Features could include walking in the least optimal direction/speed, trying to get yourself killed, activating something an NPC has to address at the least convenient times, stocking an inventory of what the adventurer needs minus an item, etc. This is by no means supposed to be a good game, but I could see it being entertaining similar to "get down mr. President.
 
City Burning Game 
You control a fire (or the wind) and you have to guide the flames to consume as much of the map as possible. Fire fighters will try and stop you with increasingly advanced firefighting techniques. The fire cant double back on its path so its possible to get trapped and put out if you don't plan ahead.
 
XCOM like game, but the setting is the drug wars in South America 
The Autodefensas rise to power strikes me as somewhat similar to XCOM.You have an organisation that is trying to tackle a rising or present geographically disperse threat that kills lots of people. In XCOM that's aliens, in South America its cartel.As for funding, in XCOM its the governments around the world. In this game, it could be local business owners and families.The complexity could be in having to work out how much to straddle pragmatism vs idealism of funding your Autodefensas, should you gain funding though illegal means but then open your org to moral corruption and cartel infiltration? Or should you stay strictly ethical, but have difficulty of getting resources... but then be more trustworthy at a later game stage with other communities you expand towards.You of course have to balance your relations and perceived threat level with the government, cartel and community. Too dangerous early on will get all the cartel banding together to kill you and your family. Too corrupt and the community will reject you. Not playing the political game with good national PR and the government will take you out for essentially embarrassing them.I am seriously surprised I haven't seen such games yet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupos_de_Autodefensa_Comunitaria
 
Racing game with horses and rebellious teens 
This game idea was inspired by those old horse books for little girls. I'm not really into racing games so I'm posting it here. It's a bit silly but I hope you get a laugh out of it at least.So, the premise is that some edgy teens are working at a stable. To kill time they start racing with the horses against the rules. Eventually the teens grow strong bonds with the horses and each other. There could be outlandish twists like unicorns and evil rival gangs down the line.As for gameplay, each rider and horse have different stats that affect their playstyle. The horses are individuals that have their own likes and dislikes and what kind of people they trust the most. In the racing levels, there would be lots of obstacles. The main mode would be simply racing, other modes could be about riding style and cool tricks. In addition to all the riding, there could be light virtual pet elements to help with bonding with the horses and improving their performance.Thank you for reading.
 
Academia, school as an adventure RPG 
This idea stems directly from a personal feeling of being underwhelmed with [Pixel Art Academy](https://pixelart.academy/about) by Matej 'Retro' Jan.  I won't get too far into that, but the idea was that of a sort of virtual "academy" you could enroll in to learn pixel art.  I still like the concept, but the execution in this case left a lot to be desired.Picture if you will an adventure game like one of the classic [Sierra](https://www.gog.com/game/space_quest_4_5_6) or [Lucasarts](https://www.gog.com/game/day_of_the_tentacle_remastered) adventures.  In fact, the overall look and feel doesn't matter too much.  A [top-down pixel RPG look](https://www.gog.com/game/stardew_valley) would work out very nicely, as well as a [side-scrolling RPG](https://atlus.com/osl/) sort of approach, or a modern [first](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/) or [third](https://store.steampowered.com/app/666140/My_Time_At_Portia/) person 3d approach would be fine as well.  Effectively any approach that gives you a somewhat open environment to explore and traverse would make for a good solution.In this adventure RPG, you're not saving the world from certain doom.  In fact, it's closer to "Stardew Valley" in terms of more domestic, laid back themes.  In this case you're not building up an overgrown farm though.  You've moved away from home in order to attend a prestigious university where you hope to master [*insert desired learning topic here*].While there **can** be a multiplayer component, a single-player focus is key.  The solo student shouldn't feel pressured by others and should be able to advance at their own pace.  There should be enough content and NPCs around to prevent the world from feeling empty even if playing solo.The game should begin by allowing the player to create and customize their own character. This is important to give the player a main character they can identify with, as playing the role of this character will be a driving theme going forward.  As your own custom student, you have an entire campus plus some surrounding locations of interest to explore.  As a student you are given your own customizable dorm room, and you have access to several resources including various classrooms, a library, and places of social opportunity.Like so many other life-sim RPGs, gameplay revolves around a night and day cycle, and NPCs go about their own daily schedules.  As a student yourself, you do have a class schedule you're expected to follow, but you aren't forced to.  In fact by "breaking the rules" a little you may discover people or opportunities that you might not have otherwise discovered.You will have some stats to maintain, but it shouldn't be too overbearing like so many other survival/life sims.  You shouldn't be compelled to eat/drink every 20 minutes lest you die of starvation/thirst.  Staying out all night to drink and socialize should have consequences, but maybe in the form of passing out drunk and waking up on the floor of your own dorm room late for class with a lower energy level.  You also have grades to maintain, and that's where the real meat and potatoes of the game takes place.The game at it's core is a school/life sim, and the "school" aspect of the game will involve an actual curriculum.  Topics should be things people genuinely would like to learn like art or programming, plus supporting content.  For example programming will involve some math, and art would involve some anatomy and color theory.  You'll attend lectures, be given assignments with deadlines, and you'll be expected to turn those assignments in for points that count towards your overall grade.  Similar to how Stardew valley takes place in a cycle of seasons and years, Academia has a cycle of semesters and academic years, and you can repeat semesters as often as you need.  Spent too long on your social obligations and trying for the high score on one of the arcade cabinets at the bar in town, and as a result you're failing a class?  Not too much of a problem, you'll just repeat the semester.  You can take as long as you need, and repeat as often as you wish.  You'll never technically flunk out.  It's a nice, low-stress approach to learning.As far as the school itself, the more fantastical and interesting the better.  The world should be interesting and filled with secrets to unravel.  It should be populated with a wide range of characters including fellow classmates and professors and all their various quirks and eccentricities.  You should be able to develop relationships with these characters by speaking to them, discovering their likes and dislikes, gifting them things, and attaining stats and achievements that cause them to take notice of you.The game is "complete" when you've successfully gone through an entire curriculum with a passing grade and can attend the graduation ceremony where you are provided with a diploma.  From there you can retake the course work and aim for a higher grade, or go for a different major.  In fact, I think there's a lot of possibility to expand the game post-release with more majors to pursue, topics to learn, new characters, professors, locations, and events, similar to how Stardew Valley continues to get content updates post-release.TLDR:Stardew Valley, but it takes place in a university, and instead of farming there's an actual curriculum where you can learn actual, useful skills, all wrapped up in a life-sim RPG.
 
A management game where you play as a giant "mother" tree that hosts a colony of elves. 
You have to grow weapons and armor for the elves out of bark and provide safe living conditions for them. In return they will protect your forest from dwarfs and other creatures who want to destroy it and you.An additional layer of complexity could be to make it so if the elves needs are not met they could turn to destructive mean of protecting their homes as well and will start chopping down tree to make stuff.ask me anything and ill expand on the idea
 
Game where you play as a hero that cannot kill 
I got inspired by batman who says he wouldn't kill anyone and that made me think of a game where you are a hero that doesn't kill similar to the batman but not killing people is very hard.Basically, you can scan the enemies to see their stats in order to avoid leading to their deaths. Such as having heart issues which means you need to be careful of jumping on them or tazing them and people with a bad digestive system which means you shouldn't poison them and allergies and etc. Seemed like an interesting idea that popped on my head. What do you guys think?
 
The Broke Adventurer 
Standard RPG, preferably open world, with class systems etc., with the sole exception from the norm being that your protagonist isn’t the hero of destiny - they’re actually just a village/city kid who happens to be good at fighting. This’ll be somewhere between a joke and an interesting mechanic: you’ll have to rent gear from shops because you definitely can’t afford it (and if the rent period expires in the middle of a dungeon some dude is gonna run up and just take the thing, causing you to either run after them and beg them to extend the period or have to find something else), bring qualifications and makeshift resumes to side quests for to be allowed to take the position, and you might have to take out a loan to afford some ceremonial armor to convince the main quest dudes that you mean business. Anyways it’s not very fleshed out yet, and I certainly won’t be able to make a game like this myself. Let me know what you guys think!
 
Every time i come with some great game idea at first it seems amazing, but as i work on it, it becomes more and more “nothing special”.Do you developers have the same problem? 
 
A game with 100% player controlled events 
A bunch of players on a server first start out in small clans, some might be warring, and some might be allied - the choice is up to the players. The leader of these clans will be chosen by players, maybe a group of players might overthrow their leader. Maybe later on the server will decide to merge clans and they will form towns, kingdoms, and even empires. Maybe some clans will decide to stay in their state and they will be known as barbarians that reside in the mountain, and raid traders(real players) on the path connecting the main kingdoms. Maybe this trader was exporting minerals for a blacksmith in another town(which would also be a player) because the black smith needed to craft a sword for another player. I think you get my point here. This game dynamic would be so cool especially if you had millions of players. Setting up entire empires, having kings that are actual players that rule over the rest of the millions of these players.
 
An RPG where the player levels up by eating 
This is a cooking style, Survival RPG. The player's stats are based on their diet. Eating heavy foods can add mass, eating light gives agility. Foods can also give unique abilities and buffs, apart from just stats. To progress, the player must gather ingredients from exploring the world and killing monsters, and learn new recipes for new dishes. New recipes can grant more skills and abilitiesCooking food is more like Alchemy in Kingdom Come:Deliverance. Players must combine ingredients using different procedures: boiling, grilling, roasting, etc. These procedures must be done in specific orders according to the recipe. These procedures also need independent resources like wood, water or metal pots. The player can develop "tastes" for specific kinds of foods, if eaten overtime. Tastes give extra bonuses for eating said foods, but give debuffs if that specific food isn't eaten over time.
 
Hitmen (a unique fighting game) 
Hitmen Hitmen is a game idea I thought about but never really took the time to go into details of what it would actually be. So here goes.Hitmen is sort of like a cross between Gang Beasts and Fight Night.I picture this game for the Nintendo switch. The graphics are cartoonish as the "Hitmen" or "Hitters" are their own species.The game is a fighting game focused on striking, dodging, and movement (Much like Boxing)Hitmen are very basic looking. At the core they are a round head, a round body, spaghetti  arms with round hands, spaghetti legs with sneaker shaped feet. Very basic.One really fun part of this game is the story mode which is like a career mode. You start out a nobody fighting your way through the ranks. From street fights to in ring arena fights, to eventually become Hitter world champion. As you progress you can unlock accessories/head shapes/eyes/mouth etc. Imagine creating a Mii but way cooler lol.Accessories could be anything from chest plates (for example; Green power ranger chest plate) to pants, masks, warrior face paint, and who knows maybe air Jordan gets wind of this and you can get some classic Jordans for your "Hitter". As far as Color customization, everything is color customizable from the body to the accessories (in a perfect world we would have a partnership with Crayola and they would provide us with they're array of colors lol)The game play is simple, as we want this game to be as accessable as possible. However you can learn more complex combos as you get better at the game. Online play would be a must as you would be able to enter tournaments online and Hit against people all over the world. The way to win a Hit match (fight) is to wear your opponent down with hits, but be careful not to use up your stamina as well. Find the balance between throwing, dodging and movement around the area. When you or your opponent is knocked down and can not get up at the count of 10, that person loses the match.As you can see this is just the basic idea of the game I have in mind, if you are a developer or like this idea and have more to add please let me know! I have very basic sketches of what the Hitters look like before customization along with a picture of what my Hitter would look like when customized to my liking also, if you would like to see that let me know.Any and all feedback is appreciated.
 
Alter Ego: Living two lives in an RPG . 
Normally when you boot up any RPG, chances are the character creator is pretty much the same: choose your race, class, abilities, skills, etc.What if you could make 2 characters at once? Instead, this RPG can revolve around the player living a double life and has to balance the two. So you could be a Fish farmer who's secretly a Pirate, or a Noble who's secretly a Rogue.This means that the first class is something simple and mundane (loop) , while the second is more situational and mission oriented (quest) Gameplay is basically the masquerade of having a double life ie Living two lives. As a farmer, you have basic day to day jobs of farming and keeping food on the table. This can feed into your secret identity of a thief: using your Barn to store equipment.Over time, you can flesh out your alter Ego during quests and missions, your choices as your alternate identity will influence your stats.To challenge the player, the notoriety of their alter ego can affect the ability to live their "normal life". More patrols means that as a noble, I have to be careful Sneaking around as a rogue
 
I knowingly / unknowingly made a game from this subreddit 
  I had a game idea after few months back watching Home Alone series last christmas. Game was plain and simple stop intruders or robbers from coming in your home and the traps will be funny and unique.  Getting into the dev, it started to become a little complicated with the toy mechanics so I thought of starting with the basics so started doing arrows and spikes and a few looney tunes stuff (anvil drop, tnt etc.). Then i read this post  : [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/8bqbzm/this\_sound\_fun/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/8bqbzm/this_sound_fun/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  I found this story too good and enticing, so I made this trailer.

The Anti-Civilization Game 
So I was inspired by a post about no player avatar in the world which led me to think abotu traditional civ-style games. So here's a "twist" on that. You are a young planet, you are enjoying all the peace and the life that you are teaming with. But there is one set of beasts in particular who concern you. They are very creative creatures and you sometimes watch them for centuries just to see what they will create next. But they are starting to spread out of their territory you had designed for them to have and threaten to cover your entire surface. What's worse, they are beginning to kill off your fauna and flora faster than you can replace it and it is beocoming infuriating. So, in this game, you are Mother Nature, Nature's Wrath, what have you, and you are trying to keep the "humans" on the world from expanding too far but because you aren't evil you are also not trying to kill them off just "keep them in check". As you advance in the game you can develop things like "Apex Predators" "Plagues" and similar "advancements" that allow you to wipe out settlements of the humans and keep their numbers down. But they are sneaky and will have "secret settlements" that are hard to find, etc until they begin to develop bows and arrows and other technology that start to defeat your own advancements. Basically you race against the "Civilization" in order to keep it from getting out of control. In a two player mode, one of you might be the traditional civ style player and the other be the Nature's Wrath player. That's about as far as I've gotten with this. Thanks for reading :)
 
Horror Mario Party Clone 
Basically, a bunch of people are trapped in an underground game show where there forced to play deadly mini games to survive, which is being televised to a society of rich people dubbed “The Black Moon Society”
 
A survival game but instead of being in the wilderness or post-apocalypse, you're a homeless person in a contemporary Urban city. 
 
an anti dating sim game. 
you were never into relationships, you just wanted to study and get good grades, the problem is, you are the hottest one in the class, do schoolwork while trying to avoid conversations, and try to divert the dozens of lovestruck girls around you, and if they keep going for you, you can try to let them off, but it may not go so well... join clubs to get extra credit, but this also means more attention, this game could go two directions, lighthearted, or dark, depending on how much the girls obsess over you.
 
Protagonist can't read; so player shouldn't either (?) 
I'm trying to make a game where the player can switch between 5 different characters at any time. They're all teens except the protagonist, who is about 4 to 6 years old.  I thought this might be a cool idea: if the player switches to her, all of the signs, books and lettering in the game become illegible, or, at the comprehension level of a kindergartener. Like all the words and letters get mixed up. (Except for the character's dialogue that pops up in text boxes of course lol.) But idk is this too realistic? Would it be too confusing to the player? I though it might also add some more challenge to the game
 
You are the companion. 
A game where you are not the main character, but you follow the main character around as their  loyal (or unloyal?) Companion. Play as a dog cat wolf etc. Watch as your NPC complains when you give away the position or attack the wrong enemy.
 
A game where you work for the mafia and have to kill police informants. It's called Whack-A-Mole. 
 
A FPS Arena game that puts you up against more players each round you win. 
It would be fast pace with small but dynamic maps. When you first join, you will be put into a larger team for instance 7 people against two people who have probably been on a win streak. It’s a quick game with a higher skill ceiling. The more rounds you win, the more likely that you will be on the smaller team in the next round with a completely different lobby. Let’s say someone who is really good is on a crazy goes on a crazy win streak, each round may go something like this. (His team mentioned first, enemy mentioned second)7vs25v53v62v81v10 And so on if he/she keeps winning and doing good. If you loose the reverse effect would happen. It would be a game that avoids random chance and factors so that a truly good player can get far, challenge themselves, and have dope highlights consistently. I feel like this idea would would with multiple themes: modern warfare, futuristic shooter, medical arena, fantasy, etcLmk what you think
 
How do you guys manage to overcome creative block? 
I'm having some SERIOUS trouble trying to get a original idea for a game I want to make. Naturally, I seached "game ideas" on reddit and found this sub - You guys are really, really creative but honestly I would feel bad for using someone else's idea for my first big game, so I ask you: How do you guys get inspired?
 
a stealth game where you are a shapeshifter. 
you are a shapeshifter, and many don't like your kind, as you try to complete your goals many people will try to stop you, either because of prejudice or because you're invading their private property.you start nearly powerless, as you try to escape from a lab. you can't really shapeshift that much and your default form is a black goo, but as you progress you learn new forms. first a few simple objects, then civilians, and eventually you can take the identity of specific people or even become powerful monsters.you have a form meter, which drains when you get hurt or when you transform into things that are difficult for your skill level. the more your form meter drains the more your true blob form starts to show, and the more people are likely to recognize you as a shapeshifter.there will be many enemies, such as:police:attack you when you're in blob form or commiting crimes. capture you when you have low form.guards:attack you when in blob or civilian form (they protect private property). capture you when you have low form.wild animals:attack everything.sniffer dogs:can smell you from a mile away, attack you regardless of form and can alert others to your presence.birds:just plain annoyingyou can't just become an object anywhere, as if you become an object that doesn't fit in the area people will become very suspicious, and some of them have very good memory of where things should be, so you have to be careful about your shapeshifting.and thats it really, i think this is an interesting idea that some might like.
 
Free Million Dollar Idea- Restoration Simulator 
Videos all over youtube. Take an old rusty socket wrench, lantern, or hand crank. Take them apart, apply several techniques such as rust removal, filing, grinding, drilling, tapping, painting, rust coating, part replacement/manufacturing...could go on and on.Make your basic game with all of those fun features set up as little minigames and then include your season passes with new stuff like historical items that would be impossible to do in real life.  Ben Franklin's Kite/Lantern. Davinci's inventions...etc...&#x200B;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbuSfqsiP7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbuSfqsiP7I)
 
An open world "slasher" game 
The core of the game would be the constant feeling of being hunted. You would be thrown into a procedurally generated post-apocalyptic map and you wear nothing but rags and no weapon but your fists. You have been exiled from your town because of the mysterious mark on your forehead, that is considered a danger for everyone around you. After one day passes, you will be informed that the most powerful enemy of the game has spawned somewhere on the map and is now heading toward your location. You cannot kill it through conventional means and it will stop at nothing to get to you and kill you.You can shake off your pursuer by hiding or putting a distance between you and it, but it will eventually know where you are: you both share a link that causes you to have random visions of where it is or vice-versa. That is why you are constantly on the move. And don't expect help from any person you meet; they will run away or threaten you at the sight of the mark on your head; nope, you are on your own.Your objectives are the following: (1) Survive your pursuer. (2)  Manage your Hunger, Thirst and Sleep bars. (3) Find a way to kill the pursuer with the clues around the map and the indications shown in your visions... or just accept your fate.That's only the skeleton of the game, but I think it would make for a very unnerving and nerve-racking experience.
 
How could a fantasy open world RPG make basic travel fun? 
What I mean by this is how could a game make the act of walking around more interesting? What I do NOT mean is random encounters in my mind they are like the garnish of a drink, a distraction rather than a solid base. Quite simply I want hiking across a mountain in a game to have the same satisfaction of hiking across a real mountain.I was talking to a friend about this after watching this video https://youtu.be/Jqx1A1vy4Zo and we both realized that in basically all the RPGs we could think of none of them had the actual travel be fun. It was always just a tedious necessity rather than any form of engaging gameplay, feeling more like walking across a mall than actually trecking up a mountain side.The ideas we came up with:Good maps with roads on them so people can effectivity navigate without a quest marker on their compass.Pack animals and mounts that act like actual living animals and not just crappy vehicles. Even companion animals like dogs should feel alive and not like robots.Very good and dynamic ambient sound, no half ass occasional bird chirp like in Skyrim. We need the forest we're walking in to sound truly alive as it is. We need to hear the waves crashing against the shore, the winds blowing across a vast desert, etc.Depending on how developed the companions are some form of idle chat mechanic where you talk about your surroundings, your past, tell jokes, discuss philosophy, etc.Dynamic weather would certainly help, especially if there were extreme weathers like floods, fires, blizzards, sandstorms, etc.In Fallout 3 and New Vegas the radio helped a lot in making travel easier, plus you got to hear of the world and your own achievements. The creators can make their lore reason for whatever black magic radio if they so please. Perhaps some sort of mechanic where a companion can read book out loud for the party would be interesting.Make the walk speed actually decent, can't tell you how many times I wanted to pull my hair out walking around Morrowind at pace of snail with arthritis.Hiring a bard to travel with you or the ability to play an instrument while walking.But what ideas do you guys have to make travel more cathartic?Edit: I'm looking at this as a journey is greater than the destination type of angle. This has nothing to do with writing and this would be in an open world.
 
A medieval war game where you're a commander that sends orders out with a delay 
Imagine you're an elite commander for a kingdom at war with another nation, so you send out troops to slowly capture territory and take the enemies out. Since there aren't any walkie talkies or cellphones back then, all of your commands come out with a delay.The delay will work so that the farther your soldiers are from you (a physical character in-game), the longer it takes for them to receive your commands. So the soldiers near you follow your commands immediately, while the ones closer to enemy base (and farther from you) will have a substantial delay before acting on it.You can reduce the inconvenience of delayed commands by having your character, the commander, move closer to the soldiers. It allows easier communication, but also makes you more vulnerable to enemy attack.For this, my idea is that the commander can only send commands or move, he can't do both. If you move before a squadron received the message, the message is cancelled and that squadron won't do that order.Imagine you went with your soldiers to charge the enemy base, then all of a sudden they unleashed a volley of arrows. Do you, the commander, run away immediately to save yourself (commander death is an automatic lose state), or do you order your troops to run away first, wait for all of them to move, then run away yourself? The former will endanger your men, but the latter jeopardizes you and the entire mission.We can also extend the delayed commands mechanic to things like: -have tiny parts of the map as "no man's land", where soldiers can't receive commands, so they follow their last command until they've exited "no man's land
 
Your game ran out of budget, and you, the main character, must play without accumulating debt. 
This is not your typical burst of escapism where the selling point is that the player can do anything and everything, destroy and create worlds without a second thought. It’s actually the opposite, a meta, comedic take on the destructive and costly nature of how games are played. The entire game plays out like a normal (imagine 2D Mario) platformer, jumping running and collecting coins, at least that is so until the first fall you take. The character then drops down, holding his knee and moans like a pained Peter Griffin. The game comes to a halt, an ambulance arrives, and takes you away. Then you return to the main scene, now a magnitude poorer by the look of the scoreboard. This is where the game really starts.The player is forced to notice the game is just a patchwork, low-budget reality TV production, bursting at the seams. The set pieces fall apart when hit, costing money to fix. The enemies are actors in costume and they play dead. If you kill one of them for real though, well, I’ll let you decide what happens. The game then becomes a puzzle where you think every moment about what action to take and how to take it. The simplest game interactions become a dreadful financial maze to navigate. Need to unlock a chest? Hire a locksmith. Want to make health potions? You know, you should take this online alchemy course.There are two ways to take this idea. You can make it a puzzle game where you try to beat a level within a budget. Or, you can make it a Truman Show mystery where the character makes choices that diverge from what is expected by the producers, and unravel a dark secret behind the “game”: They are holding multiple characters hostage and you must band together to find a way out. Or something like that. Have fun brainstorming, and thanks for reading my first idea!
 
A horror game set in the old west where you play as a woman accused of being a witch 
The game would start out with you escaping your holding cell. You'd proceed into the Rocky Mountains while being tracked by men with bolt/lever action rifles. As night falls during your escape, weird and spooky things could be in the forest that slowly reveal that you are indeed a witch which is something the player character did not know and/or refuses to believe.
 
You are standing in a house. The front door is wide open. Someone comes in; curious why the door is open. Your character bludgeons them to death. A few moments pass... you have to hide the body... someone else... you end them. Hide body. More come. More bodies hidden. How long can you keep this up? 
This is a dark VR game idea I had. Similar to thief simulator and grand theft auto ... but with a simple looping rogue like mechanism. No story. This would really need to be only in VR because what sells it would be the physics. Houses and rooms can change. Larger. Smaller. First person that comes is purely curious. Harmless. The moment you become violent - a timer starts  Add to this - having to hide the body. At first easy. Maybe even some cleanup mechanics. Closet. Soon it escalated because the next person coming might be looking to check up on previous person. Say first was delivery guy. Next it’s their Company cause GPS location. Next it’s Investigators. Next it’s cops. Pretty soon it escalates to an all out shooter where you are in a house fending off SWAT and military swarming in while appendages and arms are just hanging out of every nook and cranny  Just a looping simple game with escalating mechanics and pressure in VR. Thought about it in traditional gaming system. Wouldn’t really work. The “fun” of this needs to be the diverse mechanics that VR can bring.
 
Violent Medieval Open World Single Player game with an evil protagonist who ransacks villages and churches in the countryside 
Think DOOM-level violence in a Skyrim-like world but without too much story. You have goals/objectives/missions, but without too much dialogue or instruction. The setting will be a massive medieval world of villages, farms, forests, churches, camp sites, cities, castles, caravans, cults, etc. What the game will lack in story/lore it will have in visuals and atmosphere. Dark ambient soundscapes will play as the player stalks a farmer on a field, only to be interrupted by a torch and pitchfork-carrying mob of Christian zealots and a fast paced heavy metal track.The evil (satanic?) protagonist has no acces to magic as such, but might have power-ups or power moves. Additionally, there might be different archetypes (fighter, stealth, specialist...) who can use all kinds of medieval weaponry to mutilate and destroy his or her opponents.As the player sets churches ablaze and puts heads on stakes in village squares, the Archbishop sends word to his crusaders in foreign lands of a domestic threat.
 
A Horror/Puzzle Game About Trying To Escape Your Girlfriends House 
The concept is silly but also terrifying unique experience about you being a teenager who went to your girlfriends house when her parents weren't home. But the parents come back while you are still in the house, so the goal is to hide and try to escape the house without being caught. It seems like a game that is funny, yet scary, and one that I would personally like to play. I kind of see it as a 2D pixel type indie game. Any thoughts?
 
Wii sports vr 
So you know that game in wii sports resort where you fight with swords and fall in the water? yeah! imagine that in vr.
 
A VR game called The Caretaker, where you have to relive an old man's memories in hopes of retrieving them. 
I had this idea in the shower and I'm illustrating it as I type this. "The Caretaker" is based on a real album by *The Caretaker* called "Everywhere At The End of Time."The albums explore memory loss, and this game explores it. It revolves around ["You"/"The Caretaker"](https://imgur.com/a/mdfLEPL) seeing [an old man](https://imgur.com/a/N5lyoFD) in a desolate area who has had several caretakers in the past, but they failed to help him. Either you have the ability to see into memories, or the old man has something about him that allows you to do it.  You switch between taking care of him in reality, comforting him when he can't recall something or when he becomes violent because he can't remember.  There is evidence of his previous mental breakdowns such as a broken, shattered-beyond-repair mirror and [knocked over jars and vials](https://imgur.com/a/jWbz399). You explore the reasons for these mental breakdowns by touching them or moving the old man's hand to touch them and asking him about it.  In one instance, you have to face against the old man's (terrible) [grandson](https://imgur.com/a/XvKaqnh), who has become so warped by misremembering that he looks more demonic and fearsome.  As you progress through the story, why he became the way he is now, it becomes harder to reach deep into his memories as it becomes obscured by more and more fog. He starts becoming [increasingly depressed](https://imgur.com/a/yRN8tFk) because he can't remember things no matter how hard he tries.Your only solution is to comfort him and try to pry into his mind deeper, which involves going into the depths of his basement (a symbolic metaphor of going deeper into his soul) to hopefully bring the old man peace.(All I ask is for credit. :D)
 
A FPS game where the projectiles are relatively slow, follow ballistic trajectory, and ricochet off walls. 
For physics fun.
 
A game that starts out as a Harvest Moon-Like farm-life-sim game, but transitions into a war game as the land to expand your farm to becomes scarce. 
Farm food, make money, buy tools, hire and exploit workers, buy land to expand your farm, realize someone else bought the better land, train your workers for combat, fight with farm tools, have the best farm on the island.
 
An open world third person rpg in the vein of Witcher where 12 - 16 players occupy a single server, competing to complete quests and obtain limited amounts of funds and legendary gear. 
The game is open PvP combat.Also, some endgame bosses are too powerful to defeat alone. A player must make alliances with the other adventurers to defeat some of the more legendary bosses. Death system: upon hitting 0hp, the character enters an afterlife trial by combat where they must defeat enemies. One a few levels below, one at a similar level, and one a level or two higher. On a success, the player revives at the nearest shrine/waypoint or whatever. Upon failure, the player must create a new character.
 
Oregon Trail, but it’s The Odyssey 
What it says in the title.  Instead of a wagon train to oregon, you’re Odysseus and you lead your ship and crew back home to Ithaca, dealing with mythological obstacles and making sure you have enough food, supplies, and red-toga crewmen to make it home.It would both be a fun rogue-like and keep to the educational nature of The Oregon Trail by teaching about Greek History and Myth.
 
A Fantasy game with a large crafting system and complex magic system 
I find myself constantly pining for a fantasy game that allows me freedom within the game's world when it comes to crafting and magic. I'm finding games that have magic systems nowadays rather dull and unoriginal.**Magic System**In most fantasy games that have magic there's no actual magic just powers to equip and spam, maybe combine for more effects.I'd like a system where I have to do research and then create my spells. have different core types for the spells like attack, defence, utility. Then modifiers for target types, elemental types, duration and so on. As to allow players a complex arsenal of self-made spells that fully fit their own gameplay style. Make it so magic isn't just for combat but can be used as much as possible as true magic would. I want to see spells for travelling, custom magic traps and triggers, location and detection, daily use.**Crafting System**And then there are the very limited crafting systems the items made are very limited in use. some items are treated as consumables when in reality they aren't. For example, potions are made up of their container and the consumable potion contents. why can't I keep the bottle?I want to a crafting system where items are made up of their multiple components. So a potion is the bottle and contents. a system where I can make anything within the reason of the available materials. something along the lines of a restricted 3d modelling mechanic with simplified tools and minor ai help for solid objects, a combination system to synthesize new materials including gases and liquids.&#x200B;Now I understand that a game with these level of mechanics would take years, decades even to design and implement. But it would have so much freedom of choice I feel that not only would it be worth it but would draw in a large fanbase not only during creation but afterwards for years to come as well.
 
A steampunk game in which you climb colossal contraptions to repair them while they're still moving. 
I know what you're thinking: "Steampunk Shadow of Colossus?" Well, sort of.Instead of killing colossi, however, you're climbing all over giant mechanized vehicles, canvas-winged machines and steam-engine blimps to fix them. You're a steampunk mechanic. And instead of a vast and empty landscape, the game is set in an bustling steampunk city crowded with monorails, metallic skyscrapers and automated factories.Automation has led to a mass exodus. Citizens left the metropolis to live in comfortable suburbs and enjoy a universal basic income. A handful of critical personnel stayed behind to keep it running, but you're the only one to *move in* from a small town because it's been your dream to work on those beautiful giant automatons.****Climbing is pretty straightforward: You can walk-on and slide-down flat surfaces, but you can't grip them. You can grip and climb on any *corner* surfaces, so long as your feet aren't dangling straight down. This means edges and seams are your best climbing routes. The contraptions you climb have lots of moving, rotating, twisting and tilting parts so you'll want prevent yourself from ending up on the underside.Your backpack has collapsible canvas wings to glide down. You also have a short-range grappling plunger to use on flat surfaces. The grapple plunger doesn't wind back, so you'll have to swing to safety when you use it. You can also use the plunger to cross short flat surfaces if there's nothing to grip (much like the climbing piton in Uncharted 4).There's room for depth here. Sometimes you'll need to slide down a huge flat surface, use the plunger to stop in the middle, and wait for the machine to turn so you slide down in a different direction. Or wait until the surface is fully inverted and slide down the rope to swing to a new area.****The basic premise came from R2D2 wing walking in Episode 1 to repair his fighter while under attack. It reminded me of grappling on huge vehicles in Just Cause 3, except instead of stealing them you would be repairing them. That led to imagining huge machines with flat surfaces and sharp corners... "steampunk!
 
Video game idea to make the player feel lonely. 
Hey I just sought out this subreddit to post a quick idea but how cool would it be if everyone in a game was able to be killed, and the player would be rewarded for there murder, but as a result the world got more and more lonely. The world wouldn't necessarily punishing the player, but rather it would just allow the player to make the world eerily silent. Until eventually there was just nothing left. Another cool thing you could do with this concept is to get rid of all ambient music when the player enters a town they have slaughtered. Players naturally try to find the most efficient thing, so why not turn that in its head and make them question if it's really worth it. I'd like to hear ideas about this concept and or if it's been done before, and if it has please tell me the games names so I may play them (:
 
MMO where the ONLY way to play is to create a bot 
This isn't a completely original idea, but nobody has really done it justice.  I know there's at least one game kind of like this but it's a web game and so hard to get into I've never made it past two minutes.  The idea is that an MMO or a MOBA or a Minecraft-survival-like game has only one way to play, you create a bot.  It doesn't have to be one bot, but could be multiple bots.  Suppose it's a minecraft like game. You create the bot and program it with a language like scratch, visual, easy to use and understand.  You could start it with a number of easy to use blocks the player can take advantage of like "scout for resource" "resource is iron"  "mine resource when found"   But allow scripts to be written in a detailed fashion, utilizing an api and an ide. I would love to play a MOBA like this.  It would be sooo exciting.  I would also like to play a builder/survival game.
 
Take SUPERHOT and apply it to other genres. 
Normally I dont like when someone just applies one game to another genre, but I think SUPERHOT is a unique case.In SUPERHOT it is a FPS where time only moves when you move or do an action in game. if you dont click your mouse/keyboard time slows to a complete halt.My firt thought was a RTS game like Age of Empires 2, where you could look around the map as much as you wanted, but any clicking or "apm" would speed up time.  This gets tricky/impossible with multiplayer, but thats true of superhot too.This could apply to a top down bullethell game or something like breath of the wild as well.
 
Mobile Game idea 
I'm in the middle of developing a casual mobile game, which is an interesting take on Tetris with numbers. Here is the [snapshot](https://i.imgur.com/bhW7gQe.png) of the conceptIts a tetris setup, instead of tetraminoes, numbers drop from top and player has to arrange the numbers on the grid.Now - what are the rules for arrangement for the numbers, you may ask ? Lets make DATESYou need to make dates in DDMMYYYY (or MMDDYYYY in some geos). Once you make that date the line is eliminated like in Tetris. You can make dates from left to right OR from Right to Left. You get points for each line (or date you make). There could also be special rewards for making special dates (christmas, thanksgiving etc). There could be achievements or levels like making dates of all the months in a year. Fever mode where more 0's come..The game can be played for mobile devices ; level or time based. Let me know what you guys think! I'm thinking of 3s like artstyle..Edit : removed spoiler tags
 
RPG where you insult your enemies 
Basically your typical RPG where you can walk around, talk to people and fight enemies by spouting blatant insults, accuses, lies and curses, debuff-inflicting mocks, bluffs and taunts.The player can explore around and learn enemy weaknesses thru hearsays and gossips, stalk social media accounts, or sneakingly spread fake news which may indirectly cause damage before the enemy confronts the player. Bystanders watching the fight may whisper comments after an attack further rubbing salt into the wound. The player and the enemies may resource to physical violence when there's no options  left.Challenge: the player must not overkill the enemy, Simple surrender or a walk out is enough. If the enemy feints in heart attack, its game over.
 
Fantasy Farming Game but better 
All farming games have these generic crops and vegetables to plant and all the same animals to raise. They all start to feel plain and boring.Make a farming game that is purely Fantasy. I want to harvest juice from Giant flytraps or pick up moonlaces that only bloom at night. I want to raise vegetable lambs and squigs and blood cows. Gather hungry grasses or reap weeds that bears carp instead of flowers. Or rather pick Ambrosia or Soma or Yggdrasil plums.Add a season that makes it dark all month and watch the town lighten up with all sorts of glow-in-the-dark stuff!
 
A psychological horror/thriller that starts off as a slice of life farming game. You soon suspect the townsfolk won't let you leave. 
In a lottery you don't remember entering, you won a farm in a small town and decide to start life anew. The game starts proper as you meet the nice townspeople and begin farming the first season. But soon you start to realize something ominous is happening.On the day the bus line is supposed to resume service, the bus is mysteriously out of commission. When you try to make a phone call, you learn that the phone service is down for repair. The townsfolk are suspiciously keen on presenting you with love interests. You find a shrine that nobody seems to know about or at least mention to you. Every time you pass out from exhaustion, you wake up in your own bed. Someone must be stalking you.While renovating your house, you find markings and traces of blood beneath the floorboards. Someone in town accidentally calls you by another name. While plowing your farmland, you discover unmarked graves. You overhear conversation about "appeasing the forest sprites."If you look forward through the calendar on the mayor's wall, there's a date/holiday marked with a red X that isn't marked on your own calendar. Something is going to happen on or by that day.****You can choose to continue playing the game as a slice of life farming game, pretending that everything is fine. There's an ending for that.But if you choose to try to break free of the farming game cycle, you'll find resistance. The townsfolk become hostile and eventually violent. There's an ending for this too.There's also an ending in which you turn the tide on the town and escape. You steer the wrath of these so-called "forest sprites" onto the town itself. But the path to this ending might take a few playthroughs to discover.
 
An MMORPG which is just a big MOBA / a MOBA in which each match lasts 90 days 
I usually keep most of my ideas to myself since I plan on getting into the game design industry some time, *but* I thought this one was non-specific enough to share.I’m a long-time MMO veteran and also a long-time League of Legends player. I went to LoL after we entered what I like to call the “MMO dark ages”. As someone who was always a competitive PvP player, I found LoL super stimulating and it really scratched my PvP itch.But it left a void. I’ve been thinking long and hard about how to make an MMO with the same power to retain a player that LoL has historically had, as well as the same power to pit players of different level and experience against each other in a fair way.I think I’m onto something with this one. What if the best aspects of both worlds were combined?- A large gameplay environment featuring non-combat cities and trade spaces (basically make the LoL fountain into a town).- A crafting and resource gathering system (can be used to make potions, ammunition for defensive structures, AoE buffs that last for days or hours at a time, etc.).- A huge moba-inspired combat environment, featuring ‘outposts’ instead of ‘turrets’ and capturable resource nodes instead of ‘inhibitors’, all of which can be rebuilt or recaptured using resources or combat presence.- At the end of 90 days, one of the two sides (factions) is determined to be the winner based on factors such as score, resources gathered, monetary value accumulated, progress made across the map, etc. and the players who participated get rewards, which increase based on their level of contribution. These rewards include cosmetics, performance badges, rank progress, resources to help them next time, currency to spend on class unlocks, and such.- A new cycle begins immediately and players can choose to join the battle, and will start at level 1, but catch-up XP mechanics will help late-joiners get on-par with the average level.- The game world isn’t really changed and the player never really leaves it, but every 90 days it gets reset and so do all character levels after Victory rewards are dispensed.It would take some work to balance the factional populations to keep fairness guaranteed, but I think it’s an idea which could be successful with the right balance team on the jobEdit: to clarify, each “match” would involve up to 500-1000 players, assuming the population is high enough to accommodate such numbers
 
A game where the boss scales in difficulty the more quests/time you take getting to them. 
Not really a game concept in itself, and this might have been done to some degree already?The main issue i have with a lot of open world RPGs is that if you take your time and finish all the side quests you end up being extremely powerful and basically one shotting the main boss.But what if time wasn't on your side? It could be that you could go straight to the boss at any time (akin to BotW) but if you take your time the boss "levels up" as well and by the time you get to them they're a harder version then what you would have fought earlier. In my opinion this would give a sense of danger in preparation, but also wouldn't make the end boss feel like a wimp. This could be tied to game difficulty in some way as well?What do yall think?
 
My Dream PvP/PvE light mmo would make players monsters upon death and make the camera part of the gameplay. 
To start, I'm a big fan of rpgs with great exploration, a variety of skills, and interesting quests. I think all of these facets are essential to a good mmo, but they are not worth mentioning as a unique selling point. Consider those facets a necessity to highlight the proposed selling points. Consider these selling points on top of a normal rpg with AI monsters and quests. Selling Point 1: **Combining PvP and PvE with character death:**- All players are in the same faction while alive and playing their main characters. They can challenge other players to 'duels' but not openly attack other main characters.- Upon character death, there is a chance (1/10?) that the character has been corrupted, and instead of respawning with the death penalty you respawn as a low-ranking monster from one of several factions with unique skills.- As a monster a player can attack other players and good npcs and try to accomplish monster quests.- As a monster kills more good NPCs and players and accomplishes monster quests, they can rank up and select from new monster forms.- Ranking up also provides "monster lives" allowing the monster to choose to respawn as a monster again up to the number of lives they have.- When a monster dies, the player can respawn back as their main character. The higher rank and more monster lives they had before they respawned the less the death penalty affects them, eventually turning it into a death boon. Being a good monster rewards the player.- Monster quests also reward a unique currency based on that monster's faction, which players can use on their main character to get ingame items, unlock unique skills, and buy temporary buffs/pets. Again, being a good monster rewards the player.- High ranking monsters can choose what quests low ranking monsters can choose from. When enough quests are achieved new ones will open up, eventually allowing the high-ranked monster to choose quests that will affect the map (attack this city, kill the NPC king of this city, bury these ruins, corrupt this NPC, etc).- Some high ranking monsters can control mobs and direct them to other places on the map to help accomplish quests. Some monsters might be warriors while others are stealth focused. Higher level ranks get more specialized monsters.Rational:- Player death can't guarantee spawning as a monster since then players will purposefully die. Turning into a monster needs to feel like an opportunity to be selfish (I can get good stuff, even if it hurts living characters).- Player characters shouldn't want monsters succeeding at their quests since they will lose access to valuable resources and buffs. (reason for conflict)- Being a monster should reward players for being selfish.- Playing vs AI can get redundant, but the threat of player monsters changes things. It creates natural quests (find the monster who's been hunting down NPCs, find the monster forcing mobs to attack the mines, etc). It makes natural exploration riskier, since a player monster might interfere. It also gives a reason for players to naturally band together (when alive) and an excuse to grief (when a monster). On the other hand, 100% pvp removes the risk and intrigue (you know there is a player trying to get you, instead of just wondering if there is).Selling Point 2:**Make the camera a part of the gameplay**- Requires action combat with aimed attacks*- Players have access to a "camera" inventory slot which can be upgraded depending on the camera.- First Person Camera - Default/Empty (if your camera was destroyed), or goggles/lens. Upgrades/Benefits could include: Zoom (for sniping), cannot be damaged (no risk of changing camera views in a fight), easier to target body parts with attacks (similar to Vermintide 2, if you aim at and hit the head of a monster, you deal more damage).- Third Person Camera - A floating orb a few feet/meters behind the character allows them to be controlled from third person. Natural benefit of a better view and easier jump puzzles, natural drawback of not being able to aim melee attacks at specific body parts. Can be damaged and destroyed by enemies (particularly monsters). Upgrades: increased defense, near-invisibility- Tactical Camera (Eye in the sky): A floating orb that can raise high into the sky. Natural benefit for scouting and tacticians. Easier to cast long range AOE abilities. Risk: can be sniped out of the sky and harder to control/move your own character.Rational:- Having a destructible camera adds another level of tactics into a game, especially with pvp. It also allows for players to enjoy a wider variety of ways to play the game. For example, when combined with the Monster idea above, this means players could be exploring a cavern and a monster could attack their cameras first, restricting their view before engaging. Wars would involve mages raining fire onto the battlefield as snipers try to find and destroy their cameras. Rogues might use a third person camera to sneak around corners and dodge attacks, while a warrior might stride into battle without a camera to bash skulls in.
 
engineering game 
a game kinda like "car mechanic simulator" BUT set in a sci-fi universe say star trek or star wars and your "job" is to fix the things it could be called Starship Engineer would be cool to be able to fix/modify the millenium falcon 
 
Why does health or mana have to have non-negative real numbers / integers as values? Some more exotic choices... 
The most obvious choice would be to allow negative amounts of health or mana. Negative health might have something to do with undeath, a weird perverse state of being where healing potions bring you closer to death (defined as zero health) and damage from enemies makes you stronger. Maybe a world with living and undead beings side by side, with a matter-antimatter sort of relationship - the undead can harm the undead by attacking, the living can harm the living, but perversely, when either tries to attack the other, they heal instead.More weirdly, you might try using values in a cyclic group - the most obvious choice being the circle group - which for non-mathy people is "pretend that 0=1 and the number line rolls up into a circle". Then full health = no health (i.e. death), and healing too much would actually damage you - but if an enemy tried some sort of overkill attack, it would actually heal you instead by wrapping your health around "below zero" to a high number close to 1! This could be the outcome of an eldritch ritual that makes you a creature beyond standard laws of nature.Another choice would be a two-dimensional health bar. (Health square? Health circle?) The origin, or a small circle centered on it, would be death, and every other point would be a distinct health state. Attacks or healings would be vectors added to your health, with attacks tending to move it closer to origin, and healing tending to move it further away, but by some sort of "life force rotation" mechanic you might shield yourself, diverting an attack and turning it into something that heals you - but of course, your enemies can too. Or, if they can manipulate your life field, an enemy could curse you to take "damage" from a health potion this way. That said, you could "spiral around the drain" indefinitely without actually reaching death at the origin, if you're very careful!Weirdest of all, perhaps, might be health (note, any of these could apply to mana, currency, or any other value also, of course) that takes values on a tree - such as the free group on two generators. (Set of all expressions with two types of symbols that look like "2a+3b-a+2b" etc.) Reaching zero / death (the empty string) would require going backwards on the tree, retracing every step your health bar has taken all the way to zero, which would require the enemy to know your history - but of course, the same thing goes for damaging them. I can't even imagine how to describe that in terms of worldbuilding or meaningful analogies. But it's cool as heck.Feel free to use these ideas or not use them, however you like. But I love putting weird math stuff into game designs!

A war game where you play as each of the soldiers on one side. 
Got the idea from Chronotron.You start out as one soldier, marching into the war by yourself. You kill as many people as you can. When you die, you respawn as a different soldier, and see the soldier you previously were marching into the battle beside you, doing exactly what you did. If you kill the enemy that would've otherwise killed your past self, or otherwise save your previous self's life, he then becomes a simple AI that just shoots at enemy soldiers after the time that he would've died passes. Each time you die, you respawn as a new soldier, with all of your previous selves doing what you did before.
 
When I was a kid I dreamt of traveling. Imagine a full virtual vacation focusing on realism. 
The "Uber" drive to the airport, the airport itself, the plane flight, the hotel check-in, the hotel room, and several locations with attractions. All with dynamic audio and full length (for example, real flight lengths, but skippable). I for one would love to take a nap in a virtual hotel room with maybe a built-in video player on the tv and ocean sounds outside. This would be focused on realism and not cartoony. Think total recall, but less death and muscles. In fact! Hold on... we could call it "Utter Recollection". See? We can do this! "Oh wait, it's not a partnership." \[Mumbles to self\]. When I was a kid, once I took a trip with my parents, I played "take a vacation" all the time, because I loved the whole process. This could be an entertaining game for kids and adults who want the experience but can't or for someone who just wants to relax.I wish I could take on this project, but I have too many projects already and I am not experienced enough. Unless... you wanted to take a trip on the partner-ship. No? Ok.I realized how cool this could be when I watched a "plane passenger" 360 video and later found myself taking a nap in the oculus home. Real travel is of course best, but for relaxing this would be amazing.  &#x200B;Thank you for your time and consideration. Oh and no I am not the impostor. That was Steve. Always steve. Did I mention I want to do voiceovers?
 
A horror game were if the monster is quiet, he's about to kill you. 
We've experienced horror game that uses sound as a tool. The louder the footsteps, breathing, etc., the closer this horror beast are, the scarier it gets. But let's do the opposite, the further the beast is the louder his footsteps are. The closer he gets, the more quiet he is. A simple 180 degree in how horror games are approached.
 
A GPR game where you start at the final boss, then regress 1 scene at a time until you arrive at the beginning, Memento style. 
GPR - Game Played Reversely&#x200B;Press StartFight the final boss with max level and epic gear. Do you win or lose?&#x200B;Go back 5 minutes, you confront the final boss, you tell him he's gone too far this time and it must end.   He retorts that you're too blind to see the big picture, that you have no idea what the truth is.Do you hear him out? &#x200B;Go back half an hour, you're looting and pillaging the inner sanctum of the keep, defeated enemies strewn about, survivors huddling in fear. Do you kill them or spare them?&#x200B; Go back an hour, you're fighting the boss' lieutenants, who have obviously been brainwashed into fanatics. Some of them tell you it's not too late to repent. Do you entertain their lunacy?&#x200B;Go back a few hours, you're storming the keep atop a hill, a trail of fire and cinder behind you, columns of smoke and screams drift in the wind at the base of the hill where a town used to be. Cultists with makeshift garbs and shoddy weapons block your way, feeble, disorganized.Do you dispatch them all, or cut a way through?&#x200B;Go back a half a day, then a day, a week, a month, a year, live through conflict, deceit, loss and vengeance, until finally you're a child, playing in the dirt with your childhood friend who would one day become your enemy. You're squabbling over something childish, the details long forgotten. Do you get into a fight over it?
 
A survival game that has randomly generated creatures that you need to document yourself 
I've had this idea for a while now and never had the skills to really make it happen. Hopefully here it can get a loving creator to shape it. The premise is that you are on some planet or something like that and the plants and animals are randomly generated each time. All you have starting out is a small journal that you can write in, and you just make entries writing about the local wildlife. I don't know if it would be really open and you just write randomly with no guidelines and hope it's correct, or if you write things in specific boxes such as "The creature eats \_\_\_ and sleeps during \_\_\_" and you just fill those. I just feel like it would be cool to see a new creature and follow it for a while to study its behavior and write down your findings. maybe there's a nearby village that you can sell the entries to, and the more correct and detailed they are, the more you get paid to buy more equipment to study more creatures. maybe late game you can even go to other planets when you document everything in the starting area. All I know is that it should be open world, and you have to document wildlife yourself. Other than that, go nuts reddit. I know you'll do me proud.
 
Here's my idea. I call it "Greenlit", and I'd love to discuss it with you guys! 
 
Need ideas for a simple first person horror game 
Im a beginner game maker and i want to make a short, simple game to practice making models, creepy environments and first person controls.I need ideas for what the game will be about. Areas, story, gameplay mechanics etc.It can be anything but it is preferable if it doesn't have too many gameplay mechanics since im focusing on making a creepy atmosphere and not dynamic gameplay.
 
Day-night game, but night is the deadly key to victory 
This is my first Reddit thread, so bear with me,I'm thinking about a semi-sandbox adventure game (2d top-down?) with a day/night cycle, where "daytime" is the safest option for exploration, to retrieve resources, etc...The nighttime, however, is deadly, and filled with creatures of nightmarish descent. Occasionally, a night will be non-hostile, just to offer some opportunity. During nighttime, the whole world changes to a different color / tinted, and might be slightly modified.The important thing, is that the endgame is in the nighttime. Once every few nights that pass, a special gate will open and reveal itself. This gate should just be synonymous with any kind of entrance-- can be a mausoleum entrance, a garage door, through an underground bunker; anything (so far). The gate is only open for a very short amount of time, and opens rarely, although there will be ways to determine the location of the gate, and when it \*could\* open (something like that, which could increase over time as you gain certain resources to assist you?).The gate might lead to another dimension, where there is some final boss, ...You are able given the ability to approximate the location of the gate, and the time it opens as you start the game, but this ability is vague, ~~and is generally like a one use compass~~ (something like, gate is within 103km of you, and might open in the next 56 cycles). Ability will either naturally scale over time, or by retrieving certain devices?I have not thought of how the daytime landscape should be layed out, my gaming experience, with combination of several interesting ideas I've seen on this subreddit, tells me that an interesting take on a game should be something appearing natural but consistent through every play though, with some randomness, but modified or implemented takes on everyday aspects such as weather, and perception. I just thought of this idea, and have minimally refined it, so if any of you have any ideas or overhauls of mechanics, please share them!
 
A small town beat-em-up game in which the thugs and lowlifes you encounter all have names and backstories you can discover and explore. 
The game presents itself as a typical Yakuza/Shenmue style beat-em-up game but on a much smaller, more intimate scale. Perhaps instead of a city, the game is set in a school, mall or worksite to keep the development scope manageable. This is necessary because every enemy in the game is a unique character.At first you might assume that you're fighting the same 20 reused character models. After realizing they're the same named enemy character as in previous events, you may believe the enemy characters are being recycled to save on development. However, if you poke around and pay attention to the environmental details and follow their clues, you may discover an unfolding backstory to those characters. From those discoveries you may come to sympathize with them, or in some cases you may be able to resolve their issues and befriend them altogether.  ****The combat features a stamina mechanic that wears all the fighters down as the fights drag out, and  eventually turn fights into desperate slugfests like the end of the [Daredevil Hallway Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B66feInucFY). Your stamina drains when enemies block your attacks correctly or when you maneuver out of grapples. For most of the game, you'd assume the point of it was to force you to fight more efficiently to drain the enemy's health before your stamina runs out. But later you may realize the whole system was a massive hint that **enemies have their own hidden stamina limit** that you could drain instead of their health. All the techniques enemies use to drain your stamina, you discover, are ones you can use on them.The player's character starts out as a hero who firmly believes they have the moral high ground and has to dish out beatdowns for justice. Although the player can play the whole game this way if they want, the option is there for players to give their hero a dynamic character arc in which he has a change of heart about his enemies somewhere down the line.
 
A pirate game where you aren't literate, at least from the start. 
Being illiterate means the player sees jumbled scribbles instead of words, and sees maps in poorer detail. Successfully navigating maps, observing the signs outside of establishments, and other things like that slowly make you more literate.
 
Pool Inflatable Rafts Battle (Lazy River) Racer? 
Has anyone ever made a battle racer with the inflatable pool rafts you get when you go through Lazy Rivers? Be kind of cool to have a large lazy river where you could also have a water gun to spray opponents to either make those behind you go slower or to shoot folks off of their inflatable rafts.
 
Comprehensive Grand Theft Auto 6 Pitch 
Okay, I know what you're thinking and bear with me.I only just discovered this sub, several months after making a PDF document detailing my idea for GTA 6. I did this purely for fun and creative catharsis, as I detail in the document (for those interested in reading the intro stuff). It's wildly ambitious, borderline absurd, but I spent a decent amount of time thinking it through.The pitch is less about a personal dream storyline or setting, and more about the types of design decisions Rockstar tends to make. This includes a fair bit of criticism from a random guy with no game development experience! What could go wrong?!APOLOGIES IF THIS IS NOT WHAT THE SUB IS FOR. I scrolled through others' posts and it seemed like a pretty chill environment.Anyway, I thought, what the hell, someone might get a kick out of this. It's pretty long and broken up into chapters with pictures, etc. Anyone who gives it a shot, I'd love to hear your thoughts, as it's more of a discussion-piece than an actual pitch (obviously).[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAJEo7gYlUxuaoeZ1Z9Z5DPVOpPdp84N/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAJEo7gYlUxuaoeZ1Z9Z5DPVOpPdp84N/view?usp=sharing)NOTE: Didn't think it was worth branding NSFW but it is GTA we're talking about here, and I like swearing.
 
Civ but backwards 
You start with a bustling, happy, utopian civilization.  Everyone is honest, compassionate and hardworking.  Your goal is to ruin it.  You research new bad things and introduce them to the society.  You find synergies of things that work extra well (badly) together, like racism + corruption = oppression.Research options include:* Deception* Racism* Corruption* Greed* Paranoia* Jealousy* Slavery* etc
 
something most games should have 
instead of the armour having the stats you get a scroll that you can put on the armour for stats and the armour is purely cosmetic with a challenge system to get armour and only a few p2w armours!edit: i also think maybe if there are different classes for armour (with stats) then you can only equip a certain type of cosmetic for the class (with lots of variety's of course)
 
You are a modern soldier with modern weapons pushed back in time. You are thrown into a war against a opposing army in the medieval times and your goal is to take out as many as possible. 
This can be first person or 3rd person. You are on foot At your disposal you would have assault rifles, rpgs, mines, miniguns, sniper rifles, motars, etc. You will not get vehicles, and will only be on foot.Enemy would range from ancient European knights, to vikings, to Chinese foot soldiers, to samurai. Almost all of them are using melee weapons only. There will be archers and cavalry.Your only goal is to take out as many opposing forces you can. There is no time limit, only your death or the death of all that you are fighting against.Varying armies will have varying levels of protection against your weapons, where heavy armor it might take more than 1 bullet to take someone down.There is a morale meter that the opposing armies have and depending on how effective your methods are, you can greatly swing the favor of the battle in your direction by affecting their morale.Enemy armies can range from a group of 500 to upwards of 100,000 soldiers or more have to face. The number of people you have to take out could be dependent on if you are doing a co-op mode or not.Controls at the start will let you choose your timeline, terrain, weapons, and # of soldiers you are facing. Also, a random button just starts the game with you knowing nothing, going in blind, and doing your best with whatever the game gives you.Is there a game like this already? I want to play something like this bad.
 
How would you guys feel about making a reddit purely for game prototypes and not story lines. 
I constantly see post here that go something like.."GTA but in a different setting..""Skyrim but add everything and tons of features..""You play as a mercenary and everyone wants to kill you.."Im willing to make a moderated subreddit where instead of posting game dreams you can only post potential prototype ideas.. or game concepts..For example.Interactive Fiction Stealth game.http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=169Of course it does not have to be nearly as complex as that. But the entire thing is nothing but game mechanics. There is no story line. Its a prototype that you can look at and have a good idea of what game this person has made in his head. What do you guys think? A more mature /r/gameideas if you will.
 
A horror game about surviving your own imagination 
A multiplayer survival game where 6 people work together to make a part for a Frankenstein like monster. Each person cannot see what the other builds. Once every part has been created 5 of the people have to survive the monster they made. Using certain parts will give the monster different strengths and weaknesses. Using robotic parts will cause liquids to harm it however it will be able to scan for nearby survivors. The different part types could be robotic, undead, alien, prehistoric and a few more. The survivors must take advantage of the monsters weakness to destroy it.
 
Twisted metal style battle royale where you start as a single wheel and you loot car parts and weapons to build up your vehicle 
 
I trained an AI to make new game ideas based on all of the posts in r/gameideas 
Try it out here: [aideas.oscerlot.com](https://aideas.oscerlot.com)It's still learning, but it's been trained on the 15,000 or so posts from this subreddit!Enter a starting prompt, hit generate (might take a minute or so) and watch it attempt to construct game elements following on from your prompt. Whatever it comes out with, you have nothing to blame but yourselves.It can still get stuck sometimes or generate nonsensical answers, so just try again or maybe try a different or longer prompt.&#x200B;Example:  **A game where you play as John Wick trying to get revenge for his dog's death.** It would be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you thought he streets of New York, including the city's iconic buildings, along with your favorite thugs and street scum. It would also be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you on underground vigilantes in different cities around the city.   You can pick your method of killing. Using firearms or knives, body armor, or body parts, or stealing bodies from hospitals and hiding then, or even using the phone app of the game to call a tip or text someone who number strangers who have either high or low status.   If you die, you start all over again. Maybe you get a call from a local police department and the person in front of you decides to go out to the crime scene. Maybe your number is called back but you go out alone. You start meeting trouble after getting called to the police, and even get a call home from a distance police officer who seems to know who killed your family.   I want you to feel responsible for your family. I want you to feel your pain and sorrow. I want you to feel safe. I want to feel protected.
 
World War 2 Open World 
I've had an idea since I first played GTA V, (where you can switch between characters) to have a semi-open world game set in World War 2 where you can switch between several story lines that all eventually converge. Just an example;  Tommy - US infantry, parachutes into Normandy behind enemy lines, rendezvous with allied forces where you can find them, being careful to avoid stations of Nazis. Carry out operations and raids to set up the D-Day invasion. - The story would later continue with the invasion of Netherlands and onto Germany.   Sofia - Danish resistance fighter, based in Copenhagen your job is to nurture support for the resistance right under the noses of the Nazis. You plant bombs, carry out assassinations, distribute flyers etc. There is a lot that can be done with this story line on an open world basis.   Vladimir - Commander in the Red Army, after making a name for yourself with bravery in the battle of Stalingrad (possibly the opening mission of this character). You assume command of a rifle division. Your job is to strategically plan the advance of the red army all the way to Berlin.  William - Disgruntled German Officer - You are an officer stationed in Poland. you have a rather sinister job carrying out duties for the SS, rounding people up and stuff. You do however, have a conscious and so you have some degree of discretion. You don't get on well with your superiors and often let people go in exchange for money/ supplies/ cigarettes. Eventually you're met with a dilemma when the SS ask you to arrest your ex - lover who is known to the SS as a resistance collaborator and USSR informant. The story can go anywhere from here really but the idea would be the German Character will eventually be captured by the red army whilst the red army advance through Poland and you can have a character connection between William and Vladimir.   Similarly, Tommy and Sofia will meet up also and there will be the possibility of carrying out operations together (perhaps Tommy volunteers to parachute into Denmark to link up with the resistance?).  Anyway, its the concept of semi-structured missions, various characters across various European fronts of the war, character connections and freedom to make decisions which all really draw me to this idea. Obviously, it would be a massive game and there is also possibility to explore more characters in more fronts of the war - Pacific, North Africa etc....   Wondering what you think of my idea?
 
A game in which you're the God and you swipe left or right when people pray to you 
People constantly ask you for something and you have to decide if you want to fullfill their wish or not. You'll be able to see how your decision to help or not affected their lifes.
 
A 2D pixel art game where you are infected by a unknown darkness that slowly takes over as you progress 
I am indie developer, and mostly work on 3d stuff, I am decent at 2d pixel art though. I came up with this idea: You are a man with a dark past, coming home from the US Military, you were working on something top secret (without going into full detail). Over some time you start feeling sick, and have these awful cannibalistic thoughts. Worryingly you seek out help from the US Military, seemingly they try to help you, but once you realize they aren’t trying to help you and instead are trying to weaponize you, you freak out unleashing unthinkable power killing ever single person in the secret bunker, even the people who you once cared about, this is when you get your first taste of flesh. You escape the bunker to realize your power has seemed to vanish, making your traversing difficult as you go through the desert. As you progress you become greater at mastering these new found abilities.This is just a rough draft! Would love for some ideas to implement!
 
A zombie plague that's helpful, yet horrific 
The game starts out with your usual end of the world bit. Cities are in chaos, fighting everywhere, etc. And throughout are these horrific, mutated creatures accompanied by a deep foggy haze of spores. As you go around trying to survived you're forced to fight for your life as they monsters try ripping your breathing mask off and forcing you to inhale the mist.  Oh? But there's a twist. While of unknown origin this mutant fog is humanity's next step to becoming a better race. To you they look like monsters, but under the influence of the mist the monsters are all normal people to each other. To you they're making inhuman noises, but it's perfect speech to them. This mist was never lethal or harmful it's quite the opposite: it's make's humans unable to commit to violence and helps their brains to think more efficiently and better. The reason these beasts screech and rip your mask off is because it's them pleading for you not to shoot and trying to explain the situation but the only way they can is to help you ascend too.
 
A world of scentient boots, where you go on a quest from the deep boot city to the countryside farms farming shoe lace. 
A puzzle game where the boots of a city in the USA ( United Shoes of America ) are in a crippling drug war.A boot detective, determined to find the cause, sets out solving puzzles, making friends, and ending up in some steamy shoe yaoi. He also has a cigarette that flops around when he hops/walks/whatever.
 
A game where you are the universe's most important merchant. 
So you know how right before a big boss fight, there's always a merchant who sells you a bunch of stuff? You would play as that merchant. There would be some strategy involved when it comes to obtaining the best weapons/potions, managing money, etc. You would also have to park your station really close to where the boss entrance is and you have to track the heroes of the story to make sure you beat them to their location or the world is doomed. I imagine an eccentric character with a suitcase/backpack that unfolds into a portable merchant station. Maybe you would even have a pet falcon or a dog that can scout ahead and gather information about a good place to set up. This merchant's goal would be to acquire the absolute best material to increase the odds of the heroes' survival. There'd be all sorts of obstacles in your path.
 
A multiplayer game where the base wealth of the game is relatively finite. 
This is a relatively undeveloped idea so keep it in mind while reading/considering it. I have a business background with a game making hobby so I am coming at this from an economics view point.Most MMOs suffer from inflation because nearly everything a player does generates wealth from nothing. There are several methods MMO developers use to counter this that I will list just so you know my thought process on my idea.1. There are items that can not be made by skills that players really want. Essential buff items and other highly used items. These are bought only from an NPC of some sort and that wealth goes into the either.2. Untradeable items. These can only be sold for very little to NPCs, they allow the reward of a higher value item to a player without actually generating that higher value in the economy because 'scrapping' it or selling it to an NPC gives only a fraction of the value back.3. Fees that send wealth into the ether. Fast travel fees, market posting fees, 'taxes' on guilds, cosmetic change fees, repair fees; all of these are designed to siphon wealth out of the economy.There's other ways too but those three are big ones used by nearly every MMO.My specific idea is that all 'base wealth' is finite. The system would need to be setup in a tiered system to work, but ultimately it would work like this.1. Killing non-human things never rewards currency, only items. These items can be sold to NPCs or other players. There is a hidden and fixed unit (read currency) assigned to each item.2. When an item is to be spawned a few checks happen. The first is the server checks to see if there is enough 'wealth' in the pool to be used. The second is the 'pools' are setup around each type of drop. So any NPC that when killed has a chance to drop 'item A' looks into the pool for item A to determine if it can spawn said item.3. This step is essential, pool sizes for each item are increased per the population of the game server. So, take something like 'wolf teeth', you don't want a permanently fixed pool size of wolf teeth and then have your game flooded with people who can't find any. But that's also a very non-valuable item so for every player that joins, you increase the pool size by say 10. That means there can be a total of 10x more wolf teeth in circulation than players at any given time. Rarer items will get smaller boosts to pool sizes. This can go below 1 per player as well for very rare/legendary/whatever items as well.4. These rules only count for base dropped items. Creating an item with a skill that consumes base drop items does not look at a 'pool'. So if you can combine item A and item B to create item C, item C is always created, there's no 'pool' to look for.5. When an item is destroyed or consumed it is returned to the 'pool' it came from, this includes selling it to an NPC, dropping/destroying it, consuming it, using it in crafting to make something better, etc..&#x200B;Just an idea I had floating in my head I thought I'd release into the wild. Have fun twisting it around for potential uses!
 
Whale Hunter: A F2P/pay-to-win game where the bigger you spend, the bigger a target you become for free players. 
There was an old Extra Credits episode in which Dan made a case that F2P players in a subscription MMO are a good thing because the free players are essentially "content" for subscription players. It fills servers and give those players other people to play with.**I think the opposite can be true as well.** Whales can be content for the free players.### How This WorksThis is a PvP (and/or PvE) game where you can spend actual money on clearly better gear and leveling up. There's no upper limit to leveling up. HOWEVER, the more you spend, the bigger a target you become too. The player's body size literally increases. So too does their run stride length, jump height, health pool, etc. all increase. Imagine an enemy the size of a Titan in Titanfall.Players who kill, crit or otherwise hinder a whale, will earn an extra fraction of what the whale has spent. The whale doesn't lose money. It's more like money is copied in the form of a microcurrency. Dying to a whale also comes with a small bonus payment too so you don't feel cheated.This could be a battle royale game, a simple arena shooter, a vehicular combat game or even a sports game if modified a little.### Why This WorksIIRC in that same Extra Credits video, Dan talked about an MMORPG in which players could buy gift drops for other players. This player could use that microtransaction to come in and rain gifts upon other players, becoming the life of the party. This psychology can work if a whale effectively becomes the boss fight of whatever multiplayer game he's in. When a whale shows up to your lobby, it's like Santa Claus came to town and everyone is gunning for him. Free players get a bonus objective, while the fat whale becomes the focal point of the party.
 
The opposite of a stealth game. Instead of playing as the stealthy predator, you control the guards (RTS-style) as they search for and defend against the hiding predator. 
You control an expendable squad of hunters as they enter elaborate, open-ended rooms designed for a stealth game, except in this game you are on the receiving end. The view is top-down and controls a lot like an RTS game in that you give your squad orders and they execute them. *Fog of war* occludes anything that isn't within the line of sight of your squad, so the enemy can sneak up on your hunters if you aren't careful.A lot of the gameplay is about looking for environmental clues (broken ventilation grates, trails of blood, etc.) to track the enemy. Then you either sweep the area and funnel the enemy into a corner that will leave them no choice but to pounce. The enemy AI will also target your most vulnerable team members, so you can go the risky route and lure the enemy by leaving one or two of your guys alone.Your squad members have their own individual heart rates, and if they're too rattled by losing sight of the enemy or seeing their squadmates fall to the predator, they will begin to panic, drop stats and disobey orders. You can calm them back down by putting a squadmate near them, in which case one will calm down at the expense of making the other a little more scared.****I was thinking about what kind of story/setting/premise could benefit from this gameplay in which you're basically hunting Batman from the Arkham games. This is the premise:You belong to an agency that hunts vampires, and it recently found a sprawling gothic castle in which a number of high-value vampires reside. In order to organize a massive assault on the castle, the agency began hiring mercenaries for the operation. Now you must clear this castle room by room, all the while finding upgrades, adding new recruits and promoting your most valuable mercenaries. The further you enter the castle, the more powerful the vampires that stalk you.
 
Need an artist?! 
 Hi guys. I recently started learning voxel character design (props and environment too) and I wanna do some practice :3So if anyone out there is working on a game and stuck on the art part I'm willing to jump on for free.Below are some characters that I made few days ago 👇[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/En2t590XcAAlk\_W?format=jpg&name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/En2t590XcAAlk_W?format=jpg&name=medium)
 
A game where you fight with custom potions that you can make mid battle 
like you mix ingredients and then have a potion that makes a wall when you throw it or a pool of acid or something to power up yourself (have like a sword or something) with tons of combinations for attacking and supporting potions
 
Looking for a good first person co-op game idea. 
Hey guysI'am a Intermediate game dev, and would like a good first person co-op game idea. Do you guys have any ideas, please put them below :).&#x200B;Thanks!
 
An rpg class I'm thinking of adding - one that's focused around absorbing monsters 
This class would be the SLOWEST and grindiest class to train. You'd be able to absorb monsters after defeating them. Doing so, you would gain a small portion of their stats. Because of the unlimited growth, exp and leveling would be disabled for you.What kind of unique or cool classes would you like to see in an rpg? My favorite is necromancer
 
[Meta] A lot of these seem to be story ideas, not actual game ideas. 
(I'm going to regret posting this, aren't I?)So, occasionally some of these pop up on my front page, and about 90% of the time it's someone describing the cool themes, characters, plot, backstory, world, swords, whatever! That's great! They're interesting! **Keep building your fantasy world! It's fun!** I do it too!**But! But.**A lot of them don't really describe how the game ITSELF would play. That's sort of the barrier between it being a *theme* idea and a *game* idea. **Think of the mechanics!** That's what makes it interesting (and honestly, coming up with the gameplay is as fun as world building.)>Say, like, I have an idea for a game where...you're a soul trapped in the afterlife, where bodies are disposable tools and death means nothing, and you're on a quest to get to the top of a castle and resurrect yourself back to the living world.Sounds cool, right?...well, maybe not, but all I have so far is just the *theme.* **There's no *game* about it yet.** So, instead of scrapping that idea, **build off of it!** What would make it fun to play? You can borrow gameplay from something else as an example, or you could just describe any unique mechanics you think would be cool! Like:>Okay, so it would play much like A Link To The Past, as a top-down action-adventure with a simple sword to attack and some miscellaneous items to help you get around, or whatever!Okay, that's a start. Link to the past with a different setting. Now that you have the basic idea of gameplay **it's a more tangible idea.** What next?>By pressing L at any time you can separate from your character's body and float around as a soul. You're weak and can't attack as a soul, but you can possess the corpses of defeated enemies to gain their movesets and possibly store their bodies and switch between them whenever you want!Okay! Cool! That's better! It's a game idea now! I could go and code this if I want (movement system, attacking system, expected mechanics, etc.) now.But what if you don't have a game to compare it to? Well, you don't have to describe the exact physics or hitboxes or anything (that's something you tweak as you go) but you can **describe the gameplay loop**; basically what happens from the moment your character loads to the moment you hit game over. Say if I had NO idea what Link to the Past was. Then the description would be more like:>It'd be in a top-down perspective, with your character only equipped with a sword you can swing with A that hits a small area in front of you. Your goal would be to get from the entrance to the stairs down alive, with traps like sliding block puzzles, monsters you need to kill to unlock the door, or deadly traps you'd need to avoid. However, you could leave your character's body with L and possess any defeated enemy by hovering over it and pressing A. From there you can control them with their various natural abilities mapped to the A, B, X and Y buttons.**Now, not only is the idea about what the setting is, it's how you play it too,** not as a grand-scheme-of-things level but down to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You don't need to think of EVERYTHING in the game! Like in one of the stickied meta threads, making it too specific would turn any potential hobbyists away from your idea.I hope I got my point across in this senseless rambling. I'm not mad! I want your ideas to grow into the dream game you want it to be! But you need to think of the *game* part of the idea.**TL;DR, Think of how your game would play as well as the setting! Down to the moment-to-moment "gameplay loop", not just the grand scheme of things. Reference other games too, if it helps get your gameplay idea across better.**
 
A time-sensitive, consequence-heavy game where you pick and organize events on a King's agenda 
Time doesn't stop as long as you are playing. There's always a task at hand, unless it is harmful downtime. Choose the next one before the current one is finished.Someone needs to talk to the King? Fit it in the schedule. There's an infestation of rats? Find time to take care of them. Also consider keeping up with family relations and personal health.Each task raises/lowers a skill/attribute and prepares or unprepares you for what might come.I'm expecting comments that compare it to Reigns. It has similar qualities, but it's more focused on time and the design is more of a timeline or grid that you lay out event cards instead of flipping through them one at a time.Thoughts?
 
A Darkest Dungeon style game but instead of managing adventurers in a dungeon, you manage retail employees in a convenience store. 
Same kind of issues with madness and fear and whatnot, but "battles" are dealing with irate customers.
 
Ideas of known games / games serie but in a different setting. 
What would you do if you could take a games franchise (or simply a game) and set it in a completely new setting / timeframe / base gameplay, what would it be and why ?For examples I would like to see a Saints Row game set in middle age. It would recreate the whole gang thing but middle age bandit gangs, focus more on melee combat, the tone could be inspired by the movie A Knight's Tale. It could be a way to parody games franchises like Assassin's Creed or The Witcher.A Witcher game but a few hundred years after the events of the witcher 3. The Continent is now in the industrialization process (think about 1850-1900 England). The map would feature a big city, a few smaller one and a large countryside.A Yakuza game but set in the Meiji Era (1868-1900). A far cry game in the Congo Free State period (1885-1908,  Congo was the king of belgium private land and he employed a private army the "public force" to literally enslave locals).https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_StateEdit : feel free to share your ideas in comments !
 
Stay Your Ass at Home: The Game. 
Has anyone ever played *Don't Shit Your Pants*?    I'm thinking maybe a game in that style, wherein the player must resist the call to adventure, and stay their ass at home.     It will start with fairly innocuous things like friends calling and wanting to go drinking/golfing/whatever, and then people start showing up at the door, and then a wizard shows up, demons invade...    That's it, you just find creative ways to socially distance and stay your ass at home.  edit: Free real estate here, I don't have time to make the game right now so I'll be happy if someone else does.
 
A game where you are in control of clone(s) and can see that your actions in-game matter everytime you die. 
So the game would take place in a dystopian cyber-punk post apocalyptic city where you take control of clones via a vicarious type simulation machine. The world was destroyed by an asteroid in 1990 and the current year is 3106. Humans have since been living on Mars and the moon safe from the wastes of the earth.. They have been sending in expidition teams that rarely come back. Within this universe the company you're working for created  these clones to go to earth and salvage technology, locate and save expedition teams as well as study other forms of life. The gameplay would consist of a lot of exploration, combat and talking to characters. Everytime you die you wake up as another clone in one of many pods that the company has set up on earth. You can choose what pod you want to wake up in and what kind of clone you'd want to be. Whether you'd want to be one more akin to combat or research etc.. Every time you die you can go and see what other clones have done like making particular tribes or colonies happy, pissed them off, what buildings have been destroyed or looted and even finding your own clones dead bodies with whatever they had collected during their life. There will be tribal humans, rogue expedition colonies, old buildings to savage tech and weapons from and animals to study. Any feedback would be appreciated and thanks for reading.
 
Your words mean nothing. A picture speaks a thousand words. 
I'm getting sick of reading poorly written paragraphs of confusing nonsense.  I'm no better.  I'd be terrible at describing existing games to others.  Language just seems so inadequate for accurately communicating these things we call game ideas.Imagine describing Portal.  You shoot a portal into a wall and another where you want to go.  You can go from one end to the other and back again.  You use that to solve puzzles.  That sounds shit and it's a far better description than most you hear on this subreddit.  Yet, it's considered one of the best games of all time.So, what can be done?  Draw a picture.  Can't draw?  It doesn't matter, as no one is here for the art.  Even a shit drawing can convey what you imagine way better than your rambling ever could.  So, just open up whatever and start drawing rectangles and circles and adding text where appropriate.I'd much rather scan some drawings and better understand your idea than hoping to decipher the excessive bullshit you smeared onto the internet using your keyboard.  It can't be any worse, that's for sure.
 
What are elements other than monsters / creepy creatures that can produce a good jumpscare? 
In most horror games, the thing that hunts you down and jumpscares you is a monster. What about something else this time?
 
Overrun - A "cooperative" battle royale inside a skyscraper in which survivors are being overwhelmed by non-stop spawning monsters and dwindling resources. 
100 players start on the lower floors of a skyscraper and race to the upper floors, looting along the way, as monsters flood-in after them.There is no "safe zone"; rather, it's all about how well you can fight off (or run from) monsters while they slaughter everyone around you. Players can work together to barricade entrances or seal paths in order to force monsters (and other survivors unfortunately still back there) to use longer paths. The monsters come in waves, allowing survivors some breathing room to loot and break through to the next floors.####THE FINAL WAVE OF MONSTERS DOES NOT END  The top floor has a panic room, but it needs five people to operate the locking system. The first five people who make it into the panic room win... plus any survivors that slid under the steel door while it was closing. If any monsters made it inside, the game won't end until either the survivors kill the monsters that made it in or all the survivors die.Inspired by the trailer to A Quiet Place 2, I like the idea of running from monsters and knowing you are only alive right now because the monsters are distracted by other survivors.
 
In which direction would you want this game to go (any ideas appreciated) ? 
 
a 1954 type kaiju game where a giant robot and mini versions of it attack a city. You have to stealthy take out the robots and the kaiju robot 
 
Idea for an educational gardening game based around genetic inheritance 
It would be based on Gregor Mendel's research, and you would be able to grow multiple types of plants and actually have to take care of them and see them grow in order to evaluate the results of plant breeding. You start with a Pisum Sativum plant maybe and there are a lot to collect but the main point is to find the main well-known ratios like 3:1 and 9:3:3:1. My idea is that this could be a calming and atmospheric game that takes about 1 real week to finish and is intended to be used in middle school or early high school classes. A game that is kind of similar is that streetpass gardening game for the 3DS where you grow flowers and upgrade your garden and buy better plants. The visuals would be realistic but simple, I would want the aesthetic of the butterfly section in the animal crossing new horizons museum though. Edit: I just realised that your assistant in Streetpass Garden/Flower Town is named Mr. Mendel haha
 
Imagine an RPG game, in which you have to save your child. At the beggining of the game, you have all skills unlocked and ready to use, but after every level or chapter you are forced to manualy decrease one of the skill. At the end, you will fight boss with a little amount or even without skills. 
I.E. you are terminally ill, like cancer which eats your insides making you weaker, yet you still have to go on to save your kid from the kidnapper. You could even makes some onion decisions like, for example - you have 4 companions, you are in deep-shit situation and you must sacrifice one of your people to save other three. You pick "lucky guy" to stay behind, but plot makes that everybody dies. Everybody except the lucky guy. That would be a nice PTSD hit.
 
TCG" Cardgame Maker - Cardgame [Mobile/Browser/Pc] 
* This is a game idea where you Create your own Cards and Trade with other players , so each individual deck is unique in many aspects especially in the custom artwork department >!where it's under the user's responsability for any copyright infringement!<Features:  Card Maker with Title , Artwork ,and Features (Levels, Elements, Types, Archetypes ecc).* **This would be a great way to make the game automated since all the effects you choose are already coded by the devs,and the users must just combine them to make their own card.**&#x200B;* For Balancing  The effects are procedual, **When a card has a certain Beneficial effect the game scripts adds a cost** , **the stronger the effect the bigger the cost** (Sacrifice Points, Discard Cards,ecc)The gamedev makes   the  procedual effects which combinate with other effects to self balance.So no busted Infinite Power cards that require no cost to use. In case something needs balancing the devs can just nerf/buff the interactions, and the amount of copies of the card that can be used in a deck.* All the effects and stats are chosen and combined with pre-made structures insthead of each player coming on the spot with them, it gives the illusion of complete customization but you're mostly customizing, but also are forced to balance your own cards.Card Example:Name: LizardonRank: 2 \[Bigger ranks= Bigger summoning tolls\]Type: CreaturePower: 500Defense: 1000Effect:  Destroy 2 cards on the field by sacrificing this card on the field \[Must be summoned first by paying the summoning toll\]\[in this example  the power and defense are very low because of the strong effect ,which also has a cost of needing this card to be put on the field firstSee it as how in some mmorpg games where you allocate +2 on a Stat and somewhere else you have to do a -2 to even out the aviable numbers \]* Monetization in case it's FTP,;  Stronger effects require  Grinding wins/Paying upfrontEach player has a limited amount of cards to make,they can get more by playing more.Extra note, If the Artwork Copyright is a really big issue 3 ideas:1. Must Approve the artwork2. Autofilter and distortion on image (even maybe a style transfer)3. Custom Website/App  in which to draw/paint the artwork
 
President Mortal Kombat 
There should be a game like mortal kombat but with all the past presidents and there special move has to do with a controversy or scandal they were involved in.
 
A game where you slow down time, but doing so also shifts the apparent wavelengths of light, so the more you distort time, the less recognizable the world around you looks because of the color shifting. 
Red light shifts into infra-red, becoming black, ultraviolet becomes violet, etc.
 
Player is on the losing side of Colonization instead of the winning side. 
I've been thinking of how to represent/experience colonization from the losing side. I think it's an important subject that could be expressed in a powerful way in game format. The trick is how to make losing an experience players are willing to play through and not make it a power fantasy where player has a chance.The player starts in a fairly safe world space. Perhaps the main threats/challenges would be related to hunting and building up your village(s). Maybe the first half of the game would be building relationships with other villages or dealing with feuds between some. Then 50-70% of the way through the game the colonists show up. The rest of the game becomes a series of difficult choices where the player must choose to fight back or adapt/surrender to the will of the colonists. Any aggression towards the colonist would lead to X times the aggression back, making it a losing battle. Attack one of their bases and they destroy two of yours as well as increase patrols.This could cover some really heavy subjects like language dominance, culture, history. Though possibly hard to express in game format. You could have a skill system that is tied to village building. So you do quests to build up a village/town and get some benefit back. Build up agriculture to increase your max health or hunger meter. Help an elder keep their position of power to gain an ability. Archives of writings, weapon and armor smiths. Maybe training grounds for NPCs to fight with you.And once colonists show up, they start taking over the land on the map, including your people's town's/villages. Once you lose them you lose the skills and equipment they offer. You and your people slowly get weaker as the colonists get stronger.Fighting back against the colonists would only accelerate their progress and increase their numbers as well as how violently they treat your people. It becomes a game of compromise, where you always come out on the worse end of the deal.The end goal is just about how long you can hold out. How much of your culture and how many of your people can you save.
 
Funny notification game 
So this is just simple funny and stupid idea. The whole game is just application displaying stupid notifications on your phone. You can set how many notifications you want to have displayed in a day. The notifications are created by other users and sent to other random anonymous players. Players can rate the notifications they got and the best notifications get sent to more people. The players who create best rated notifications gain score. The player with highest score could then unlock new functions like creating parody adds displayed in game etc. Other parody features could be added.
 
Gladiator Manager (game in progress) 
I've always wanted to play this type of game, especially on the phone, but I never found anything like it, so I started working on it  :D (it's in early development stage).**Genre**: strategy/managment**Platform:** mobile/pc**Graphic**: 3d**Theme**: fantasy[Gladiator Shop View](https://i.imgur.com/vYte1Mh.jpg) \- layout design for one of the views (includes placeholders - models from synty store / icons from flaticon / background also not mine).I decided that it's a good idea to gather some feedback about the concept which maybe help me to make this game better. I also like games where you have to code a lot cos I'm mainly programmer and I love UI/UX design (now I'm working as web developer).**Game concept:**You are the manager who collect the team and develop it in certain way in order to win the tournament.  Before every round you are able to buy 1 of 3 drawn gladiators (you can have max 6).Than you pick 1 of 3 drawn weapon to the new team member you just obtained. There are no other types of items. You can follow the whole tournament participants tree and prepare for your next fights.Enemy gladiators are created in the same way as player create it's own team (there is a algorythm which combine available units with weapons and upgrade stats based on game progress). I didn't want the player to face nameless creatures in countless amounts all over again. When you enter arena you watch the combat in realtime. **You don't control the combat**.&#x200B;* gladiators are various races with other perks (2 tiers with 2 perks each) - I'm trying to keep it small but I want player to have different choices* each weapon has also unique perk tree - I want player to create various combinations of unit/weapon* I hate useless stats in games (playing warrior means you max strength etc.). I tried to design the main statistics in such a way that the derived statistics were useful for all units.**Strength** \- hp / power**Agility** \- dodge / haste *(attSpeed/cdr)***Intelect** \- crit chance / tenacityEven *crit chance* will be useful for all abilities, for eg. unit with warlock staff which summons undead, if crit will be triggered it will summon stronger minion.&#x200B;The challenge for the player is to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing team and properly prepare your team for the upcoming fight.&#x200B;I have 3 main **inspirations**:**Albion online** \- one item totaly can change the way your character fight.Mod to warcraft3, **Orc Gladiators: Revenge** \- a great challenge, setting tactics for the next rounds, trying to balance tasks for individual team members.Other mod to wc3, **HellHalt Td** \- strong dependencies between the types of attacks and defenses of the unit force you to carefully plan what units to buy to win the next round, while thinking about further rounds, which sometimes require longer and systematic saving of resources especially for them.&#x200B;Maybe I am getting old, but  I started to like games  that don't require too much agility from me, but at the same time I like to influence the game in the planning / preparation state and then observe the effects of my decisions :D**I will appreciate any feedback, THANKS!**
 
Looking for an urban legend / creepypasta / good idea that fits my needs for a horror game. 
This week I've been busy looking for a good story for my next horror game.I prefer my next game to be based on some sort of urban legend.Like the horror game 'Aka Manto', it's based on a Japanese urban legend that takes in a Japense school.The game is build around this urban legend and it really fits the story.I've been busy looking for other cool urban legends, however I haven't really found one yet, that's why I'm asking for your help guys.There are some requirements for the story however:- The enemy needs to be a humanoid (female preferred) and needs to be hostile towards humans. (So a bad/violent character that has a reason to attack the player / hold the player hostage.)- The story needs to take place in a medium / large sized building (bigger then an average house). (in a school / hospital for example)So a story about a certain humanoid that lives in the wild, isn't applicable.- I'm looking for something original, so not your typical nun story.- I prefer stories based on urban legends, however any good creepypasta / horror idea is welcome as well!I'm curious what you guys have in mind, the game is going to be developed for Windows, Android and iOS.If someone here is able to provide me a good story that I will use, he/she will get the game for free.EDIT: I want to thank everyone for his/her help, I'm probably going to try my hand at La Llorona. Other stories like Futakuchi-Onna and Kuchisake-Onna do interest me as well, so does the skinwalker. I'm very happy with the help and noted everyone's name in this thread (who replied before my edit). After my game is out on Steam, I'll PM everyone a free key. (I expect this game to be released before the end of 2020, but I'm infamous for not reaching my deadlines. So feel free to PM me me after 2020 if I haven't PM'd you a key already!
 
A game where you play as multiple civilians masquerading as one urban Vigilante 
Kind of a mix between Sims and FalloutSetting: Modern, dystopia undergoing civil uproar after a horrific event. You take control of special "agents", civilians living undercover in the city, each with unique jobs, skills and abilities, all taking missions under the same guise: a legendary Vigilante. The trick is, each agent has a "cover" that the player must maintain in order to keep their character from being apprehended/killed by the authorities (can lead to rescue mission/permadeath). So each agent must maintain their job, status, relationship and health, etc to remain active (playable) Missions are location based, each serving to further the cause of the revolution and push the story forward. New locations, agents and new gear for the Vigilante to use can be unlocked per mission completed. How the player solves each mission affects the livelihoods of the people around, and in turn, affects how easy/difficult it is to maintain agent's covers. You can recruit new agents using the ones you have to "make contact" with them.
 
Can somebody help me with and idea for a gamejam? 
So, I'm participating solo on my first game jam. Its the Blackthornprod game jam, and the theme is "Less is More".I've though about a post man, that would have to deliver as many letters as it could, and the lesser letters he would return to the station, the more points/money he would gain.But I could not find any fun Gameplay to that.Can somebody help me find an idea, or develop this one?
 
A horror game where people are trapped in a death game against each other, and you control the systems to save them. 
Your super-rich grandfather is an insane but gentlemanly megalomaniac who abducts people and puts them into those only-one-can-survive psychological game settings. The people end up betraying and slaying each other. (A lot of Japanese movies have this scenario.) The game is on an island with no known communication to the outside world, just a boat back.But you aren't one of the captives. You are the grandson. You've only just discovered that your grandfather does this, and he has shown you how the labyrinths, traps, limited items, time limits, and announcement systems work in the hopes of passing it on to you when he dies. You aren't insane like him, though; this is to your horror, and when you get into a heated argument with him he has a massive heart attack and dies right in front of you. But before he croaks, he turns everything on and sets the game in motion to doom the 20 people inside.So now you have to stop the horrible game. You can't turn it off. But you do have privileges to make it work one way or another. The goal is to save as many people as you can. But to beat the system, you have to go INTO the labyrinths directly and face the traps, the logic, and yes the people who may or may not trust you. You'll need to use what they have as tools, too. If someone doesn't trust you, you may have to kill them, but what will the others think of you then?There are wild animals that stalk. A.I. that mislead victims on the computer panels. All sorts of things that make your life harder.So while all the tortured deaths and betrayals are going on in the normal 20-man game, you have to not die yourself to the whole system as well as delicately get the people to trust you. How you choose to use the intercom system is key. You must also learn more about the systems to disable them one by one. And some people will never forgive you, so you are being hunted even after you save whoever you can save. Get them into the boat, then find the secret radio communications to finally get off the island yourself another way.It may be possible to save everyone, and in that case everyone will trust you. I imagine this being pretty character driven in addition to the gameplay, so you really feel like you get to know these people, which is important in this psychological-horror movie genre.
 
A Puzzle Game Played Inside Your File Explorer Using Shortcuts to Other Files 
 
Help make my idea for a PVP card game better 
Mostly for fun I've been trying to come up with an incredibly simple, fun to play physical card game. The game I most recently thought of is a PVP game (RPG-genre-esque) and loot based. The problem is it sounds interesting but not quite "fun".&#x200B;The premise is simple each player starts out with empty slots for 8 pieces of equipment (head, torso, right arm, left arm , right leg, left leg, main weapon, secondary weapon). Players take turns drawing cards from the deck. When you draw a card you may look at it. Each card will be a piece of equipment that could potentially fill a slot  (ex. a breastplate for torso, or a robe for torso, or helm for head, sword for weapon, bow for weapon, etc. typical stuff). Each item will also have unique stats (+/-Atk, +/-Def, +-Str). You can decide to either put that item in it's matching slot face down replacing any item you currently have in the slot, or you can discard it. You must fill the slot if it is currently empty (so at the start). When you add an item to a slot it increases your characters (your own) overall stats by that amount so say +4 Atk, -2 def, +3 Str. Some items have a Str requirement to use, so if you draw a card and don't currently have enough overall Str you must discard it. Some items also have set bonuses adding to the overall stats. Players may look at their slotted face down cards at any time.Players continue taking turns drawing cards until every slot is full for both characters (so at least 16 draws total). At that point you must decide if you think your character can beat the other players character, you continue drawing cards but at any point on you can yell "BATTLE", meaning you have decided enough is enough and you want to battle. The other player get's to finish out their turn if they did not go first and it goes into battle round. Both players flip over all of their cards. You tally up you Atk points and Def points, including any set bonuses. The attacking player (the one who yelled "BATTLE") has to have a higher Atk stat than the defending players Def stat. If they do not, they lose.As you can see, it sort of fizzles out there in the end. I personally really like the idea of this kind of "Deck building" where the deck is your character, with the different stats mixing and bonuses being applied. Allowing you to go for more defensive builds or glass cannon builds, or balanced in between. But then it all boils down to a card flip where you can probably pretty easily game if you're going to win or not (if you roll a bunch of high Atk stats items you yell 'battle' first, if you roll def stats items then don't battle).Any ideas on how to fix it?
 
A strategy video game or boardgame where you play as the head of the goverment response to a zombie outbreak in a city, and have to manage different operations, departments, and political groups to prevent anarchy and contain the virus. 
So basically the main concept of the game is juggling differing groups while also preventing public unrest and hopefully ending the zombie outbreak. You would have different ways of dealing with the zombie outbreak that would utilize different groups, for example you could research a cure using scientists, contain it using police and later military troops, manage public relations with the public, quarantine certain areas etc..But the interesting part would be say you put too much time into the research part and the zombies get out of control and overwhelm local order, say you gave the military too much control of the situation, boom they overthrow you and establish a military autocracy, or if an area has too many infected/not enough goverment control and order it will lose trust, fall into chaos and not be able to be controlled. Maybe if the district with power/water gets overwhelmed with zombies/chaos the entire cities trust in you would be affected, or encouraging citizens to become armed and fight back may have unintended side affects if they lose trust in you. Just interesting choices and strategy ideas.Its a rough idea but i think it would be a pretty awesome strategy game, and a unique perspective from the zombie genre.
 
Magicka as full fledged MOBA 
I think it's time to take games like LoL, Dota, Hots etc to another level.Remember Magicka by Paradox Interactive? You would use keys to combine elements to create a unique spell. I think that ability concept could create huge replayability, watchability, and massive skill ceiling if it was well implemented into a multi-lane objective based MOBA intended on targeting an esports audience.Paradox made a pvp objective based map that was entertaining but their game obviously wasn't designed for pvp in that sense. There's a couple major changes to the concept for the MOBA, firstly 8 elements at once is too much. Cut it down to like 3 at a time like Invoker from Dota2 but with maybe 10 to choose from total before matches. Secondly not everyone wants to play the same character. Make "roles" like tank, healer, etc by limiting the number of elements and their combinations creating the role. Like Earth + Shield+ Nature would be making tanking/healing spells with those combos, or Fire + Lightning + Arcane is some sort of glass cannon mage. Have weapons to vary combat styles between ranged and melee with spells changing depending on weapon type. The biggest challenges are obviously balance and spell interaction. Should there be a GCD? Powerful spells should have longer CDs or cast times. Add counterplay to spells with noticable animations and cast times etc. Have terrain altering spells but also have other spells that can destroy it with proper element combos. I feel like if Riot can balance the 200 champions they have in one game then this can be balanced. A super responsive fast-paced moba using this concept would be amazing to watch. There would be tons of builds and new content could be made by adding weapon types, differing maps like Heroes of the Storm, and items. It's giving players the option to add way more customization and fit into whatever role or mix of roles they want while still being a hardcore MOBA. There's a ton of room for innovation while also being super competitive; at higher levels the game would require the APM closer to Starcraft and the mind games with all the spell options would be insane.  I feel like there is a good idea here it just needs good execution.

A highly advanced Spore like game. Stylized like the film series Life Beyond by melodysheep 
I have long hoped for a new spore game or a remake. I loved making creatures and evolving them into better versions of themselves. When dark spore came out i was intrigued by the more "grown up" style that it had. But I was disappointed by the game mechanics and the missing creature creation that made spore so good. I recently saw the concept film Life beyond ll and loved the art style and visuals of both the creatures and the worlds. I think a game where you could explore evolutions like in the early stages of spore before you got to the more advanced (and boring) space exploration parts would be cool. Would love that the game had an emphasis on the whole evolution part and would dive deeper into the details within evolution of the creatures. I think single player is best for the game, but would be cool if it had some kind of share space where you could share the creatures you’ve made. I believe spore had something similar. Don’t know if I used the correct flair, im new here.
 
naked and amputated, a game about surviving while crippled in multiple ways. 
in this game you wake up in the wilderness, some body parts crippled, some straight up missing.at the start many body parts (including limbs, eyes, ears, etc) are randomly chosen to be disfigured, crippled, and even completely removed from your body, drastically affecting your playthrough.what i am thinking is part roguelike, part survival, with elements of neo scavenger, cataclysm dark days ahead, and similar survival games.this game is about feeling weak and near helpless, trying to scramble your way out of a bad situation, because you don't have an arm or leg to spare.the goal:get rescued, find people who will help you, that is the end condition. once you're in society, you essentially win, you get a wheelchair and have a famous news story. you can finally feel like a member of society rather than a weak struggling feeble creature constantly on the verge of death.what do you think of this idea? i think it has some potential as an indie game.
 
a reverse dating sim. 
you have been accepted into a prestigious school, dedicated to be a top student you will let nothing stand in your way. the only problem is you are one of the hottest guys in class and it seems everybody has a crush on you.deflect, delay, and diffuse the other students crushes on you.join extracurricular activities to improve your grades, but be warned, you might attract more students.say you're gay when she refuses to stop, and open up an entirely new can of worms.nearly get kidnapped and call the cops on a childhood friend turned yandere.get straight A's and go forward to a bright future.thats basically my idea, tell me what you think.
 
A game about being a tree in the Rainforest. 
I thought of this game as I learned about the Wet Tropics of Australia.Basically, the main idea is that you are a small tree that just sprouted in the rain forest, and you have to control your way up towards the light. Whenever you are in the light, you grow 2x faster than normal, so your goal is to become the **tallest tree**.The trees around you move at the same pace as you, and some have different abilities, like growing onto your tree and blocking your way, or preventing you from expanding outwards. 
 
Had this idea years ago, before I joined reddit. 
You start at a character creation screen, where you're given all these awesome options for traits, some of them chosen at random, and almost enough points to max out some stats.After making the final touches and saving, you're taken to another creation screen with less options, and about half the amount of points to go into stats.You are informed that the character you previously made is the antagonist, and you may have to face them later.
 
Pyramid Scheme Simulator 
Edit: Someone asked for a GDD, so I wrote one: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IS3tAGeVJMa46ZNJg1\_p4LsIqHAP3QFDJrz7jGQQmQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IS3tAGeVJMa46ZNJg1_p4LsIqHAP3QFDJrz7jGQQmQ/edit?usp=sharing)A game where you run an MLM company. You start with some stock. You find NPCs on the street, then get into "battle" with one NPC: like Pokemon, but instead of battling them, you convince them to join your company. You can then "recruit" other NPCs in a similar manner.Then those NPCs can automatically recruit other NPCs, depending on their skill level and stats. You have to manage the recruits directly below you and whatever they are doing to recruits below them.You have to manage the income, convince people to join below you or someone else (recruiting directly below you is easier but costs you more money, so you wanna put them below your recruits and possibly their recruits - it could be a whole tree!)You also have to figure out ways to spend your money on advertisements and lobbyists to make sure that your company lasts.What do you guys think? I really wanna make this game myself, but I don't have the time. So I thought I'd share it!
 
Making silent protagonists more realistic? 
Take Rook from Farcry 5 for example, he/she's as silent as the Grave for the entire course of the game with a mumbled "yeah!" During fishing being the only coherent word they ever speak And maybe it's just me but it almost feels like the Npcs are simply talking through you rather than to you.Something i think would make silent player characters more immersive (especially in Rook's case) is adding a simple nodding mechanic wherein players either move the camera up and down or side to side to mimic head movements and then having npcs respond accordingly.
 
A game where different characters = different gameplay types completely. 
This may sound damn near impossible, but imagine one game where the character you play is like choosing between Doomguy, Ryu Hayabusa, Witcher 3 Geralt, the Dark Souls melee build, or a spellcaster from Dragon's Dogma. Not exclusive to just these gameplay styles or being these styles either, but just an example. Completely different genre-based characters in one game. The idea of making a game like that work somehow would be interesting. Each character aren't mechanically different on a similar way, like most games with just different strengths and weaknesses, but play completely differently in the same title.
 
[FPS]You're in your office when you realize anything and everything you pick up turns into a gun. Then suddenly, your workplace gets attacked by Russian terrorists and you know EXACTLY what to do. 
You pick up a coffee machine, boom, it can spit lead.Paperclip? Sure, it can fire mini bullets.Your office keyboard? Make em' rain hell.Other coworkers? SURE. Hoist em' up and start blastin'!Edit: If you've made this, please link your gamejolt or itch.io page, I wanna play it.
 
Pestilence - a stealth based game about pests 
The player spawns into the level as some sort of pest animal (ex. mouse, mosquito, fly, tick, flea, cockroach, silverfish, moth, snails, caterpillars, etc.) and has to avoid the attention and wrath of the humans it cohabits the home with (and possibly other pests that may want to eat it). Throughout the game, the GUI changes to mimic that particular pest's senses (ex. a fly would have blurry, compound vision which allows it to see a wide FOV, so FOV is set to 270 and the graphics are a bit blurred). Players get points for doing species specific tasks (ex. flying near light sources for moths and fly players, finding mates for moth players, or landing on food for fly players). After a relatively easy grind for the player however, the humans catch on and start to bring out the tools designed to bring about your demise - fly swatters, fly paper, baseball bats, cleverly disguised live traps, deadly traps that mimic food, water, light, heat, mate odors, etc, whatever the pest is attracted to. The player has to determine whether food is food or food is actually a trap by examining clues about the mystery item. There may be some puzzle elements to determining whether something is safe or dangerous as well, but the player is required to make a decision fast due to the gradually increasing hunger meter. Game may have upgrades (ex. quieter footsteps for rodents, anesthetic for bloodsucking pests, etc.). For blood sucking pests that have landed on humans or pets, the screen may move with the host to clue the player into whether the human is about to move and squish them.
 
Not a game idea but an idea that we could implement in games. 
Instead of having arbitrary sensitivities in video games, we should instead have an angle calculator sensitivity. For example you would type down the length of your mouse pad and the angle you would want your crosshair to travel for sliding your mouse that length, i.e : In csgo with a qck heavy you would have to set your sensitivity to 2.4 in game and 400 dpi in order to do a 360 degrees when sliding your mouse from one edge to the other, valve could add an option with the qck heavy 360 degrees sensitivity as reference and then you would just have to put your personal mouse pad length and the angle you want your crosshair to travel one sliding your mouse from one end to another. Simple cross multiplication.Edit : I think adding an option such as (cm/360°) or (cm/180°) for both hipfire and ads is much better and simpler actually. So 2.4 ingame and 400dpi in csgo is approximatively (45cm/360°).
 
A first person shooter in pitch darkness. 
The player must shoot terrorists in pitch dark. He has an ability which will help him. He can shoot sonar pulses which travel and illuminate the position of terrorists and obstacles just for a moment. Terrorists can move in the dark, and player too must move in the dark and guess the layout. He can only use certain amount of sonar pulses every level.
 
Taking a step back in Spell Creation. 
[What inspired this idea was this photo.](https://i.redd.it/neaoqp0gvdc21.jpg)In a lot of games, spell creation or enchantment are really, really boring. It's basically just "Acquire rare ingredient. Shove rare ingredient into weapon. Done!"What if *spell creation or enchanting were also a game*?I found myself wondering; what would lead to a tattoo design like that? Oh! What if each different shape amplified a magical effect in some way? So, for example, you have a system where *crescents* enhance the power of a spell. *Straight lines* effect the range. Complete circles effect how much magic the spell can hold. Maybe the checkered part influences the type of effect it has. Meanwhile, the amount of ink you have to work with is controlled by the ingredients. So, for example, [look at this image!](https://i.imgur.com/u1rjlG8.png) Fire essence might draw lots of crescents but be very poor at making circles. While Electric Essence might be great at circles, but terrible at lines! BUT, if you try to overload a spell with too much of one, it might change effects entirely, or the entire spell might just collapse under the strain!And *then*, you can have advanced spell effects that do other things by balancing the various amounts in different amounts! For example, a spell that has perfectly balanced Lightning and Cold essence might provide Paralysis. So players would start out with a very basic spell. A straight line connecting a circle to a crescent. And from there, the *players* would have to fiddle with the system to create better spells, find better ingredients, read books ingame on spell creation, and ultimately grow in skill at an *actual* crafting system that is closer to art than stat allocation!Net result; what once was a boring tedious slog could become an actual fun part of the game.
 
A game about that one nameless soldier who appears less than one or two minutes then die in an apocalyptic horror movie 
I got that idea from that one scene in the *Gyo Tokyo Fish Attack* OVA where that one soldier in a gas mask is being surrounded by bloated fish people on spider tanks before its cuts, leaving you a idea of his fate.I can't think of a lot of apocalyptic movies with a military focus, you're always following people like you and I watching the world we know going to shit. What if you played a infected apocalypse game where you don't play as your usual horror protagonists who hopefully make it out alive through a lot of plot armor. Instead, you're that nameless, faceless soldier we commonly see but know nothing about except for the fact that he received instructions and is following them. You don't have loved ones you're trying to get to from the other side of the country (or at least, none that we know of), you're not carrying the cure to save mankind, you were just sent to clean the area. Now the situation has gone out of control and you have to find your way back to base or just get the hell out here, wherever the path you take may lead.There have probably already been games like that, but I want to talk about the thematic around the protagonist. The sense of anonymity behind the character, with nothing outstanding about him is what I find interesting. No background. No backstory. No face reveal. No supporting cast - except maybe control if you can reach them. The characterization goes as far as what you would see in one of zombie movies - "It's dangerous out there! Get out of he-\*dies\*". You're not even the marine who's going to defeat the hell invasion all by himself because apparently, you were the only one in your squadron competent enough to not die. You're just an extra, a nobody who we can at best assume enrolled to serve his country and is now trying to make it out of this hellhole.A slow-paced, camera-over-the-shoulder gameplay like in the Resident Evil 2 remake would probably suit the concept best, but, despite being a trained soldier, you would get a dramatically worse feel of isolation and vulnerability. You're not going have a wide range of weaponry. No grenade launcher, no flamethrower and definitely no bazooka. You'll have your rifle, your pistol and a few grenades at best ; ammo is limited so you'll soon realize you got to pick your fights, instead of going all trigger happy and burning through your precious ressources. You could even apply a rogue mechanic, reflecting how easily your character can be sent off as a narrative device to build a sense of danger.A few additions:\- While trying to survive, you could encounter some of the few survivors and you could do the next four things: (1) You try to escort them to safety (2) You ponder whether or not the physically and/or mentally damaged are worth dragging or best left to die - or even put out of their misery. (3) You eliminate them because they show signs of infection - why not even shoot every person on sight just to be safe? (4) You leave them because you don't need a bunch of civilians on your case when you're trying to save your skin.\- Zombies are overdone. Body horror is where it's at.

r/Gameideas inspired-game hits the App Store & Google Play 
[Original Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/47ddj2/carrier_battle/)After 2500+ hours in Gamemaker I’m excited to finally announce the release of Carrier Commander: War at Sea, a game right from this subreddit.

A game featuring twin Protagonists, But there’s a twist 
One of the twins is blind whilst the other is deaf. The main concept is that you play off there strengths (The deaf one being able to see and the blind one being able to hear) in order to progress through the game.I don’t really have a specific genre In mind but this concept could work for a puzzle or horror game
 
I've got A TON of game ideas in my head, and I'm going to show you some! 
1. A turn-based game where you use your name to spell attacks (Anagram Fighters)2. A game where you play as a dollar bill that can split apart into smaller currency (The Amazing Splitting Dollar Bill)3. A puzzle game where each puzzle is different and every puzzle turns into the next i.e. a simple 9-piece puzzle that turns into a Simon Says game (Puzzleception)4. A multi-genre game where you you play as different objects around the house (Thingventure)5. A 2.5D platformer where you play as a sticker on a pop-up book exploring (Pop-up Parkour)6. A puzzle platformer where one character can only move left and vice versa but the characters can switch positions (Lefty Lucy and Righty Ty T.)And last, but not least,7. An "experimenting" game where you turn letters of the alphabet into toys. (Alphatoys)What do you feel about these ideas?
 
The Borrowers: The game 
So i was watching the studio ghibli film "Arriety" and it got me thinking, what if you were to make a game about surviving in a person's house as a tiny person, living off the scraps and unwanted trinkets that are discarded?It would be a survival/crafting game with base building with option to form your own community of tiny people, go it alone or join someone elses community (so might be a multiplayer title or just AI communities).The more you create and "borrow", the more you level up, unlocking more craftables and abilities for your lil guy or gorl and your community at large.Just a little idea, could make for a fun lil game, let me know you guys thoughts 😁
 
A game specifically about being a wizard/witch 
I know there are a good handful of games that have magic, but the only ones that focus on it seem to be borderline first person shooters.&#x200B;What I'm thinking of is something more research based which still lets you fight when needed. The idea is for every single spell, utility, ritual, potion, etc to be something you discovered/ crafted/ summoned.&#x200B;Say you're a witch that lives in a swamp. You start out with nothing but by running into a magic tree and maybe gathering a few herbs/ killing a magical beast, you craft your first wand. As you explore the world you might discover ancient texts or something which lets you learn levitation. From there you might make your house and start researching properly. One of the things you could research is different wand/staff types which enhance a style of play.The gameplay would be about researching magic stuff and exploring to gather ingredients/ discover new spells/ perform rituals. As an example, maybe if you learn healing spells/alchemy and help a nearby village, you start getting paid and gain a good reputation. Maybe adventurers come to you to buy potions/ enchant weapons and in return you can ask them to give you a certain item they they'll get if they succeed in their adventure. IE: If they're slaying a lightning dragon you ask them to bring you back scales so you can create lightning related things like a lightning spell, or resistance potion, or enchantment to make a lightning weapon. If you REALLY want them to succeed maybe you can join them for that adventure.&#x200B;What you learn would depend on what adventures/ research you decide to partake in. You don't just say "I wanna be a pyromancer." If you wanted fire-related spells/potions/items then you'd explore a fire related area like a hell dimension, volcano, etc. Because of this one could specialize, but it wouldn't be through throwing skill points at different trees, it would be through discovering different things at different areas.&#x200B;The spells would be very unique and not just a different flavor of fireball. Of coarse there would be a fireball, but also utility stuff like flying/nullifying fall damage with air magic, or freezing with ice magic. There'd be some necromancy, illusion, mind control, etc. This would make combat much more creative and fun. Also, I think it would be best if things weren't number based but like Magic Maker/ Wizard of Legend where the spells just work. Of coarse there would be enemies and environments where certain types of magic are more viable than others but everything should be usable to an extent. For example: if you're exploring a cave, fire would be much more effective because of lighting and closed space. If you're out in the open, air magic might be more viable for mobility.&#x200B;Finally: I think there should be different main methods to progress. You should do some combination of methods but specialization should be key. What comes to mind is:&#x200B;\-Making your own magic base/tower and having it be a hub for teleporting to other dimensions, farming reagents, exploration, and research. After enough research maybe you can make familiars gather basic ingredients for you and explore. Through enough research/trial and error you should be able to eventually create more powerful things.&#x200B;\-Becoming a royal magician for a kingdom and get the majority of your resources through conquering/ trading. This could give you trade routes access to all the magical research that kingdom has/gains. This is the more social way of getting new potions/items.&#x200B;\-Join a guild and help adventurers explore obscure areas/ gather cool items that help you research.&#x200B;I know this is pretty broad but I'm shooting for a full magic experience which rewards research, adventure, and/or trading/conquering. Every spell and item would be gained through a decent process and would be very valuable depending on your play style. The closest I can think of is the minecraft mod "Thaumcraft". I think a game with this level of detail but maybe not as confusing as minecraft mods would be amazing. It doesn't need to specifically involve these mechanics, but what's important is slowly building your magical arsenal and feeling like you earned your magic spells/items rather than just upgrading skill trees.&#x200B;Edit: I found a game in development called Artificer, it looks pretty spot on. &#x200B;&#x200B;
 
Mistlefoe 
 
A game that starts as a typical RPG, where you get companions, one by one. And when you have enough it turns into a strategy game where you control a squad, then an army, then may be even many armies. 
 
The best car game for car enthusiasts. 
So im not close to a game designer or a developerl, but i think i got a good idea of a game. The game is about the career of a person who build cars, but the diffrents from other games is that there is so much room for customizations. If you are gonna build a engine, you can build crazy builds like in real life, and the only limit is your imagination. What i was thinking for the mechanics is that, you can build a v8, like you would in Car Mechanic Simulator 2018, but you can put on a turbo, or two, for exemple. Or you can fit a big engine in a smart car. You buy parts, and build your engine to your dream car and customize everything. Then when you're Happy with your build, Take it to multiplayer and show it to your friends, and race with it. It is just an idea, but i would love this to become a game.&#x200B;Sorry if my english is not the best.
 
GTA should collab with Cities: Skyline to create an infinite amount of maps to play on 
Each city built would have its own strong suits and flaws in design and maybe gta could center its story around the corrupted urban development and have dynamic quests that take the stats and layout of your city into account.
 
A game where you play as a ice cream cone 
So basically, you are an ice cream cone trying to traverse the level. The main gimmick is that you slowly loose health and melt when not near a fan, which will keep you cool and restore health. You would have to fight possibly bugs and small animals. Possibly there could be collectibles that allow to become a different flavor of ice cream and give you some special ability.
 
A Home-Alone Styled Horror Game 
# ABOUT*You're relaxing in your home until you receive an anonymous phone call. The person warns you that within 3 hours (30 minutes real time), a group of henchmen will attempt to break in to your home and kidnap you. It is your task to fortify your home with traps and survive until next morning.* # GameplayThe game would have two main settings: the afternoon and the night.AFTERNOON: Whilst you would be able to lock your doors and close your windows, it wouldn't be enough to protect yourself. The afternoon would be a sandbox-like experience where you will gather resources in your home to create elaborate traps. Pre-built traps like a bucket on a door, or a trip wire would be available to you, but you could also create your own traps. Ultimately, you would have enough freedom to create traps like in the movie *Home Alone:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYjWYoS0Hk*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYjWYoS0Hk)NIGHT: The night is where the horror aspect would unfold. The main form of horror used would be  paranoia and suspense. Spooky soundtracks will only be introduced if the player was to actually encounter a henchman. Otherwise it would be dead-silent. A good example is this one part in *Duck Season:* (skip to 2:24) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtK2kiMJ4Xs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtK2kiMJ4Xs). Relying strictly on sound is where the paranoia sets in, as floorboards creaking might either be the henchmen or the house. I think the game *Visage* is the perfect example of what I mean. Your character would also react to sudden sounds and events through his breathing or heartbeat, like in *Outlast.* I also think it would be cool if your character would shake and change postures depending on how scared he was. In terms of art style, I wouldn't have it scream horror to you, but rather let the player determine whether or not they are in a scary situation. For example, the game would look rather cartoony like *Firewatch.* The trick is to surprise them with horror. A good example of what I mean is in the game *Subnautica*: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87nMEZE5s-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87nMEZE5s-g)# StoryI haven't thought of much regarding story, but here's an idea: the anonymous caller was you but from a different universe. Somehow you and your alternate version switched universes and are now being tracked down by elite units (henchmen) to investigate and exterminate.
 
MMO Guild Manager 
I've been wishing for a game similar to the concept of sports managers (Football manager), but in a MMO world. You start of as a single guy who creates a guild and recruits new people, you go on to clear the most simple dungeons and progress further and further, ending up recruting more people until you clear the most difficult content.Imagine It's A Wipe (https://store.steampowered.com/app/330620/Its_A_Wipe/), but way more fledged out and detailed. I have tons of ideas for features like a general mood and trait system which leads to synergies and or problems between certain members, different ways to distribute loot, different ways of recruiting, different ways of leadership and so on.Edit: So if anyone reads this and thinks about actually doing it, don't hesitate to DM me.
 
What if the game designer lies to you? 
A game which starts off in classic fashion: menu, options, start game, tutorial......but then, after you get the basics of the game, in follow up interactions with you, the game narrator and UI of the game itself start introducing information that is purposefully wrong and get you into trouble.After a while, it becomes obvious that the game designer is diagetic (in the game world) and is a character who tries to either make you fail, or use you to get to his own goals (which don't align with your own goals as a character or player). Hence, the game designer is the bad guy too.. xDI guess this is a similar idea to Stanley Parable (or Nier), and invites you to think about the following: how can the Game Designer lie to the player?I'm not talking badly designed UI or UX here, I'm specifically talking about "lying" to the player as a game challenge that the player must overcome. Maps with wrong information, tutorial pop-ups that invite you to do mistakes. Narrator that purposefully lie. And most interesting of them all....the game trains you on mechanics on one way, and then, throws a challenge that requires you to do the opposite of what you learned...
 
You are the Zombie and need to cure yourself 
I'm just tossing this idea out there cause it was literally a dream I had a bit ago.You are a Zombie, but you are the intelligent kind, which is incredibly rare, like winning several lotteries in a single month.Your character is a scientist, or at least he was til the virus broke out. After years of being one, he finally regains his humanity, but he still craves flesh, and while he wishes he could just treat it like an addiction, it's not that simple.He needs flesh to keep his own organs from decomposing, the virus will start to devour internal organs if he doesn't get his daily meals.You're not confined to a basement or facility, you will have to venture out in to the world to find humans to feed on, but you have to find a way to keep them fresh without biting them as that will turn them, then you won't get to feed on that one anymore.You have two bars that affect your HP. External and Internal. External is damage you receive from external forces, like bullets and such.Internal is when your organs start to get eaten. You regain HP for both by feeding on fresh flesh.The game is over when your brain is destroyed, can't find a cure without it. You won't have to worry about rest, needing to be hydrated, but you will need to find food and the proper equipment so you can find a cure. This is a Zombie Survival game, just reversed. While you won't have to kill zombies to stay alive, it is a good idea to do - too many zombies in the world means less people you'll have for food, but kill too many and you'll have a bigger problem. So, if anyone wants this, go for it. I doubt I'll remember much cause dreams I've had do fade. What kind of game you want it to be, your choice, you're the one making it. Same goes for the name of the game and the character.Edit: If you do make it, should probably consider the other comments on this.
 
New move to replace the dash in platformers 
The concept of a “dash” is extremely overused in platformers, 2d and 3d alike. Celeste, hollow night, ori, and a lot of other games have the dash in one way or another. Are there any other traversal options that are similar to the dash, but not exactly? (Not diving, because I already plan on implementing that if I make a game.)Or are there ways to “revolutionize” the dash, or make it more interesting?I’m asking this question because I am developing a moveset for a 3d platformer and want you’re opinion on this topic.Edit: you should be able to perform it in midair.
 
I want to kickstart my videogame developer CV 
I'm a Computer Science engineer student in Spain, who's currently working as a Software Developer in a small company to make a living while I try to make my way into the videogame design world. I've been hearing a lot that to work as a videogame designer you have to make games, so that's what I'm trying to do now in my personal time.We are a team of two, both Computer Science engineers (well, one that's already an engineer and I'm a year away from it) so we are pretty comfortable programming. I'm also pretty good at drawing and started to take some practice on an Ipad Pro to get better digitally (even though I feel pretty clumsy here but I'm trying to improve my skills every day), and my partner is an excellent programmer, he's a natural, so I think we make a good team.I'm here searching for some suggestions for the first game to add to our portfolio. We will also have a brainstorming session and see where that leads us, but I've been thinking about ideas and I can't get my mind to something achievable (we can't spend three years developing our first game) but also interesting and with a cool mechanic to make it special. So I'm here interested in other's points of view, recommendations, advice and concepts.I may be asking too much for a first game... but I think the bigger the idea the easier it is gonna be to develop the game, as we can make the idea smaller and remove features to make it easier or if we see some of them are gonna take a lot of time to make.
 
An open world survival game about laying cable between cities to connect them for transit and trade. 
In this fictional world, anything can travel through cables, including you.At the start you don't know much about your objective. You just know you need to survive and you have a limited number of these cables to help you. You're dropped in a randomly generated world with difficult to traverse landscape and creatures of varying danger. You can unfurl a cable behind you as you traverse, and at any point you can instantly transport yourself or your goods between the two ends. You might soon realize you can use this to gather one material in one resource spot and use/refine/craft that material in another far away spot. You can even \*send\* things through the cable.You can move cable you had already laid down, connect them together end-to-end, or even slowly roll one back up to collect it. Cables are hard to come by but some can be found just laying around while exploring. Before you collect one you randomly found, it's often a good idea to travel through it to see where it leads.### That's how you find your first village.The people there give you a new crafting recipe for a machine that will periodically extract resources if you put it on a resource point (so you don't have to manually extract it yourself). You put two and to together and connect one of those machines directly to one of your cables so that it brings resources straight to you. Brilliant! The village says that they desperately need X resource, so you venture to make one of these connections to this village. Once you do, the village turns into a town. Now this town starts producing some useful new commodity to trade.One of the people in that town is obviously not from there. He says he came from a different village somewhere in the North. That's when you might realize that the game's true objective is to connect all the isolated communities to turn them into productive, interconnected cities.****Due to the theme of traveling through cables, the setting would best fit a digital/virtual/computer world.
 
What makes a "relaxing" game fun? 
Before I start working on my dream RPG, I decided to make a small game centered around exploring a small town. No combat, just walking, talking and some platforming.  I should note, it will be 3D (UE4).My current idea involves a snowy town inhabited by penguins.  You, also a penguin, wake up inside your little igloo.  You can waddle around, meet some new people, and just wind down with a cup of coffee.  As I was first tinkering, i also wanted to make the prospect of walking fun. And this a fun mechanic was born; sliding!  Press the interact button to belly flop on the snow and slide speedily.But with all of this, what keeps gameplay fun?  Why would people keep going back to play it?
 
I made a Game based on an Idea from this Sub 
Based off of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/aqyq47/a_game_where_you_literally_watch_paint_dry/), I made a Mod for the Source Engine where you Watch Paint Dry. I expanded on the idea a bit further than it *just* being about watching paint dry, but I did try to keep it the central idea.

A game where you are the mayor of a town that needs to save as many lives as you can from a neighbouring city that got nuked 
So I am a huge (read: huuuge) fan of Kurzgesagt and I have been watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPH-br_eJQ) they made a while back about what would happen if a city got nuked. I was thinking what the humanitarian effort would look like, and thought that it could be made in some sort of game.  1. You select a major city to get nuked (like DC, New York, London, Moscow, Shanghai, Jerusalem, Sydney, Rio, etc.) with different climates, amount of emergency preparedness (cities which have earthquakes could have more rescue helicopters?) and population.2. You select a small city nearby that you are the mayor of (like for New York, you could be Trenton, New Jersey or for London you could be Oxford or Reading) which affects how many rescue personnel, budget and hospital space you have3. You select a time of day (7 AM, 11AM, 3PM, 6PM, 2AM) and day (Sunday / Tuesday) that affects where people are and whether they are awake or asleep, as well as the climate and year (one month of year) that affects likely weather as well as potential for hypothermia or heatstroke4. You select a nuke size, which affects infrastructure, population at risk, radiation levels and other things like that.5. You play! The cities you didn't select also help, and undamaged outskirts of the city can also help with relief.Not sure how gameplay would go, but the aim is to save as many people as possible. Lost rescue personnel and people who died due to lack of treatment (i.e. if somebody was dying of ebola and you stopped their treatment so a nuke survivor could get treatment instead) count as deaths too.
 
I think it's time we have a [VR] flair for virtual reality game ideas. nt 
 
A Pokémon game that shows how hard it is to become a Pokémon trainer. 
You are always the “chosen one” in these games. We need to see the crushing reality that 99% of kids fail at becoming a successful trainer. Like where you can lose if you don’t have what it takes and are forced to restart the entire game.
 
Short and easy game to make on game maker for a (basically) complete noob? 
I know how to code basic things in game maker but never made a real game.
 
A town / city-sized public transport tycoon game 
I love tycoon games, from the old classics like Sim City and Transport Tycoon to the newer indie ones all around Steam.But one sub-genre of it that I have always been missing was a game about public transport.It would not be like Transport Tycoon (and all it's newer brothers and sisters out there) since you would be limited to just one town or city and you would not have control over regional trains or airports, shipyards etc. because they are run by the state and not the city.It would also not be like Sim City, Cities Skylines and so on because you would not have any control over city planning. The quality of your public transport lines would have an effect on areas of the town though (commuters getting to their jobs or not, areas with bad public transport being less desirable etc.)You would have to consider changes the city makes – like building a new high school or a new neighborhood with lots of new apartments, making sure these are well connected to the public transport system. Or developments "from outside", like a new high speed train connection that requires you to upgrade your lines to the train station due to more passengers arriving / going there.A first tutorial scenario could be a small town in the 1960s, where buses where the main means of public transportation. You have limited budget and have to plan your 3-4 first lines wisely. There would be a simulation mode, where you can plan the stops and lines in detail without building them. The tutorial teaches you, that you have control over the lines' schedules – the game would output the arrival times for your chosen routes for all the stations and you have control over "waiting times" in stations or mandatory breaks at the end of the line to control the lines' schedule. The game then makes you plan a line that correlates well with the hourly arrival time of a regional train at the town's train station.Later you will move on to bigger or more complex cities. Like a European Capital around the year 1900, where busses didn't exist but streetcars did. Or a well developed city in the year 1980 that grows so fast it finally needs its first metro lines. There could also be more unusual things like funiculars, aerial cable cars or boats (thinking of Venice here).Investments in streetcars or especially metro lines are VERY expensive and the metro tunnels would not appear the second you build them. There would be construction sites for years that negatively affect (public) transport in the streets and therefore your existing bus or streetcar lines. Getting rid of a poorly planned metro line is basically impossible, you can just close it but the tunnel would stay there and be sunk costs.I'm curious about what you guys think!
 
If there were no technical limit in designing a game where thousands or millions of players interact in realtime on the same screen, what (best if simple but lots of it) kind of gameplay should they do together? 
I ask cuz as a researcher of computing theory, I believe it is possible to have a million players on the same screen in realtime, even if only 1 pixel's color is controlled by each, or gradually between that and fewer more influential players. Its just hard to experiment with that without a specific proof of concept in mind.
 
Suicide King: a gwent-like trading card game that uses normal playing cards that is easy to understand and get into 
so i just came up a game like this when i woke up. it's a two-player trading card that without the trading part: it uses the good' ol 54-piece playing cards, aces to kings four suits, and two jokers. i call this game **"Suicide King"** because i like the nickname for King of Hearts.i always feeling the entry barrier of tcg tend to be very steep, you have to learn all the weird mechanics, collecting different cards, often cost you real money in order to play decently. so in this game, no grinding is needed, the mechanic is so easy to learn that even I, someone who barely played any card games can explain to you in a single reddit post.&#x200B;the objective of Suicide King is this:* to win more rounds than your opponent (like gwent)* one game is divided in 3 rounds, whoever wins 2 rounds, wins the game (like gwent)* whoever have higher points after the round ends, wins the round (again, like gwent)* your point is the sum of all number cards on your part of the field &#x200B;the playing field looks like this:[https://imgur.com/a/zzQMF4H](https://imgur.com/a/zzQMF4H)* there are two rows that you can place your number cards on (remember gwent?)   * on the right is the deck, there is a number showing how many cards left (start from 26)   * on the left, you can place special cards for special effects (more  on that later)   * each row houses 5 cards, plus a special card, a total of 11 cards can be played for each player* a big yield button because sometimes you just dont feel like it* an end round button to end your round* click the deck to draw a card* a point counter between your rows (i forgot to add)* maybe a history window of some kind idk* a win-lose marker like gwent would be helpful&#x200B;this is what the cards do:* number cards:A - 10   * you can place them on both of your rows (except A), the sum of their numbers are your points, front and rear doesnt affect the point.       * (eg, you have a 5 in the front, a 3 in the rear, you have 8 points)* special cards: A, J, Q, K, Jokers. They stay on the special card slot to the end of the round, until the player replaces them.   * Aces are both number and special cards. can also be played on your opponent's row.      * you can play an Ace on the row, by doing so you can choose its point. it could be 10 or 1 (as in blackjack). choose 10, the card shows 10A, it's a 10-value card. choose 1, turn into 1A, has value of 1, and making neighbouring cards suit the same as the Ace's.      * or place it in the special field, double the value of the cards of the same suit. (ie. double the points of all spade cards if you play an Ace of spade. turning a 10 of spades into 20 of spades)   * Jacks are warriors, they can either defend your field or occupy the enemy special card slot. they work differently depending on the colour.      * when playing on your special card slot, a J can protect cars from Attacks. (as in hearthstone)      * you can also play it on your opponent's special card slot to occupy it, they have to attack it to remove the card from the slot, so they can use it later. if the slot is occupied, remove the card and occupy the slot.      * a Red jack can take 2 attacks from a black card, but 1 attack from a red card.   * Queens are magicians, they have special actions depending on their suits.      * these actions are available right after playing the card, and later each move.      * Diamonds: select a suit, add the number of cards of the suit in your field as value to your point. (including Queen of Diamonds itself and the Jack in the opponent's special card slot)      * Clubs: swap cards depending on the target. if targeting a card on the field, you can swap a card on your field and your opponent's. vice versa. or when targeting a card in your hand, swap it to a random card from your opponent's hand. (cannot targeting special card slot)      * Hearts: shuffle cards in on of the hands or rows. the total of cards stay the same, but the cards could be different.      * Spades automatically draws a card whenever you played a card on the field. if there is no cards left in your deck, sacrifice a random card on the field and conjuring a new card in your hand (passive)   * Kings are schemers, their effects are only activated when a round is ending.      * Kings are invisible in the slot, your opponent wont know you played it. but can be revealed by Jacks and King of Hearts.      * you can play a king within the same move. (ie before and after playing another card)      * diamonds: all cards on 4 rows are annihilating each other, the difference is randomly send to each player. ie, if your opponent has 7 cards on the field, you have 2, all cards get in to a fight, and 5 cards left, randomly distributed among players. if it's an odd number, you have one more cards than your opponent, in this case, you get 3 cards, your opponent gets 2)      * clubs: (i dont have an idea yet)      * hearts: remove cards from the field place them into your hand, also makes you lose the round. (suicide king, winning by losing)      * spades: all number cards that got destroyed in the round are played accordingly in the field in the next round. (including aces)      * if both players has a King in the slot, whoever plays the King first activate before another one.   * Jokers are ultimate chaos maker. unlike irl playing card, in Suicide King, Jokers come in two colours: red and black.      * when red Joker is played, randomise all cards on the field and conceal their numbers and suits. only colour is visible (reveals kings). you can also see the colour of cards in your opponent's hand. attacking your opponent's card with your red car, your card have 50% survive the attack. at the end of the round, reveal all numbers and suits.      * when black Joker is played, ditto with red Joker. but instead of making red card stronger, when you attack a black card, there is a 50% chance that rob the black card to your field (which ever is available, if none, to your hand) with half the value. 2 will turn into A1, odd number will be (+1)/2, aka a 9 becomes 5.      * if A, J, Q, K are revealed on the rows, they are treated as 10, 11, 12 and 13.       * Jokers cannot be replaced or attacked, not even Jacks.game mechanics:* game: a game is played in 3 rounds, whoever wins 2, wins the game.   * if a player have no cards on their field, their hand or the deck, they automatically loses the game.* round: a round is ended when both players ends their round, the points will be tallied and determined the winner of the round.* resolving a draw: if both plays' point is equal, whoever has more cards on the field wins the round.   * if both has an equal number amount of cards, the winner is determined by the order of the special card on their slot. Joker>Ace>K>Q>J      * if no special card is present, a winner is determined by the biggest number and suit combination of their cards in the row. ie 10 of spades vs 9 of hearts, 10 wins.* point: the sum of all number cards' value in your rows. with other modifiers.* value: the number on a number card. it can be modified by other cards, making a card that doesnt exist in real life. aka a 20 of spades. A is can be 1 or 10, as in blackjack.* ending the round: the player can click the button to end their round. the player needs to perform at least one action to end their round.* move: within a round, players will perform an action one after another, normally only one action per move.* action: playing a card on the field, attacking a card, draw a card from the deck, or spells from the Queen card* field: 4 rows of number cards and 2 special card slots* rows: 2 rows of slots, divided into front and rear. number cards can be played on the rows, each row houses 5 cards. whenever there is a card in the front row, all cards in the rear row is Protected.* special card slot: A, J, Q, K, Jokers can be played on the slot. the card stays in the slot until the end of the round, or replaced by player. special card cannot be attacked, only Jacks and King of Hearts can remove them.* deck: a standard playing card deck with 52 cards and 2 jokers. at the beginning of the game, all cards are shuffled and divided into 2 decks of 26 cards for each player.* draw(action): the action of retrieving a card from your deck to your hand.* hand: cards that available to play on the field for each players, at the beginning of the game 7 cards are drawn for each players.* graveyard: the concept of spent cards doesnt not exist in this game.* attack: the player can use a number card to attack an Unprotected number card on the opponent's rows. the process destroys BOTH cards (with exceptions) (just like hearthstone, but no health or attack value)* protect: a concept taken from hearthstone. cards in rear row is protected by ones in front row, whereas all cards is in turn protected by a Jack. the attacker cannot attack a protected card without destroying the card which protecting it.* destroyed cards: the result of number cards' mutual destruction&#x200B;that's all i have in mind, all numbers are very not final.
 
A post-apocalyptic Stardew valley-type genre with a massive open world. 
TL;DRA top-down 2D tike-based engine similar to Stardew valley. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, your goal is to restart civilization. Long:You, the PC, awaken from an exodus cell. You don’t know who you are or what you are, all you know is that you were meant to awaken. After some minor exploration, you make your way out of the facility you were in and find the first NPC. This character is a grizzled old man who is running out of days on this earth. He teaches you the basics of rebuilding and survival, and then passes his property and equipment off on to you. He becomes the first NPC. You can explore a massive open world. All of the NPCs  would be out in the world just waiting for your rescue. You help them and bring them back to live in your village. Each character would have his own demons and backstory, along with unique interactions with the other characters. There would be well-written and thoroughly developed characters that hopefully don’t fall into a stereotype. Maybe there could even be a Judas type character to throw a twist into the story.The village would have an amazing building system, with modular building pieces that the PC can “put” together. The building could even change appearance based off of the materials used. The PC can “customize” his buildings to be basically exactly what he wants. The engine would be designed to handle the PC input to generate beautiful hand-designed buildings. The interior of each custom building can even be customized too. The world would be very large. Multiple biomes, and riddled with ruins and other hidden secrets. You can get to anywhere from the very beginning as long as you can defend yourself. The world would have collectible and renewable resources for the PC. There would be animals, and basic vehicles, and horses, and numerous pets, and all sorts of amazing things to fill the world and make it come alive. At the very end, the Judas character would make an attempt on your life after he discovers that you aren’t what you think you are. He is secretly part of a neo-fascist group that existed before the calamity-type event. (Maybe a massive war??) He learns that you are a genetic clone bred from the DNA of the old man’s great grandfather. The old man throws himself in front of the bullet meant for you, and sacrifices his life. You face down with the Judas character and defeat him. You can choose to either kill him or bring him to your side. The game can then be played afterwards with numerous side quests and hidden secrets. I’ve always dreamed of a game like this. I’m hoping to start this summer.
 
Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to render more convincingly human NPCs 
Natural language processing can produce dynamic conversation (speech to text allows user speech as input and outputs the chatbots text into vocalized responses)https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nnuSQvoroJoThis allows NPCs to have a far greater degree of interactivity with the player.  This can be even further maximized if we parse body language using neural nets set on motion matching with a broad framework of dialogue and conversational mocap to blend and draw from.  Body language is dynamically responsive in life and those cues can inform our responses, feeding enough data into the black box used, and the neural net can approximate the output that sync most naturally into the conversation.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o-QLSjSSyVkhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnu1DzFzRWsFacial expressions can be mapped to conversational cues and matching lip movement organically, neural nets let AI video bots already mimic human speech fairly accurately.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PqbB07n_uQ4  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CaZzXqYyR94Procedurally generated ontological mental models can inform the internal workings of characters and their understanding of, and relations to, the world around them.  You can vectorize this character knowledge in order to run nearest neighbor regression neutral network behavioral analysis, and use machine learning to dictate how NPCs respond, while simplifying the memory load.  http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro3/GameAIPro3_Chapter37_Simulating_Character_Knowledge_Phenomena_in_Talk_of_the_Town.pdfDelay likely because of having to run NLU and parse then produce responses can make conversation awkward- conceptually, this could be “faked” by using a translator effect, explaining away the delay due to having your speech translated for the NPCs passively and it being done when they speak in return.  This could also help mask some of the stilted dialogue from the bot generated text, as it could have that “lost in translation” handwave available.  If the constraints of processing and producing so many effects can’t be reduced enough to have a minor delay like a translator, one could also use a sci-fi conceit like communicating over great distances in staccato messages Ping-ponging back and forth with a somewhat more significant delay.  This has been used to great effect in media like Interstellar or Voices From a Distant Star, messages could still be 3D, always look for a good chance to break out a Starwars style holoprojector.Could possibly examine what story conceits might lead to this fish out of water situation, and it could give us an interesting perspective to approach from as an outsider to a culture.  However much you hide processing in the background to buy baking time, you can ultimately offer a more dynamic and interactive character system which can much better sell the immersion of conversation.  **TL;DR** https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrj4S24074
 
A Just Dance type game but for martial arts. 
I feel like with technology nowadays, why couldn't we have a game where you use your camera to track your position but instead of dancing, it's martial art styles and techniques. Especially with games like Ring Fit Adventure, where it's pretty good at keeping track of your arms and legs, for the most part.
 
Dating sim, but you've already won the girl. Now you're married, planning a family, and you have to keep her - i.e. avoid losing the spark and divorcing. 
I don't really have paragraphs to add about this like I usually do; this is a game I legitimately have no interest in making myself, but I have a strong suspicion that there are people who would enjoy the challenge. Heck, there's probably people on this sub that have been through something similar and can base some of the game on real life.
 
Evolution Battle Royale 
It would work like a mix of Spore and the Hunger Games, where a set number of featureless creatures all spawn into the wilderness at once. The main premise is that over time, or perhaps by killing non-player prey, the players would gain DNA points to spend on upgrading their creatures with limbs, defense mechanisms, and body shapes. You’d probably also start out with a few DNA points, though I’m not sure how you would spend them... maybe through resting? Anyways, the goal is to upgrade your creature enough to the point where you can take on other players, and eventually be the last creature standing. Some examples of upgrades would be claws, horns, armor plating, scent tracking, venom, muscular arms or legs, quills, grasping hands, thermal vision, echolocation, night vision, and probably more. In general, things that would aid in both survival and combat.Just an idea that popped into my head.
 
An Anti - Battle Royal 
Like the title suggests :a Game where you have to kill yourself as quickly as possible using the evironment, weapons, explosives etc. The last one to be alive looses the game. Mechanics that you can use against other players are somewhere along the lines of: healing grenade, or a bubble that slows their fall, so that they don't die and live longer etc.could be fun, especially with squads (that gives suizide squad a whole new meaning xD)
 
A dystopian "City builder" where you remake a normal city in your ideology's nightmarish image 
A city builder along the lines of Cities Skylines where you transform your city into a fascist/ Socialist/ Capitalist/ monarchist/ theocratic dystopia with different winning conditions according to the ideology. The objective is to quell protest, spin your failings in a positive light, feed on hatred and crush hope.There'll be a political panel that allows you to sign decrees and make grabs for power by spending political capital accrued by completing missions and removing barriers to your power. Some of these barriers might be me figureheads for the resistance, taking care of journalists, race riots etc.Edit- Also, researching dystopian tech like the screens from 1984 or an AI that regulates society like a market or a cybernetic police force that reads out bible passages while beating down protestors.Edit edit- Some kind of social engineering screen like alpha centauri where you can pick future ideologies like a cybernetic dystopia
 
A video game where you start with a full skill tree that you have to gradually shave down and make decisions about what you could go without. Plus this gives a natural difficulty curve 
 
User Generated Single Player RPG 
The core concept would be a bit like Runescape with tons of skills, and all sorts of quests and grinding. But almost the entire game will be generated by users, and the AI. There's no end goal, just skill, build, craft, fight, and get generally beefy. It's specifically intended to never truly end.&#x200B;Here's the more interesting bit. Once a week (or so) it gets updated. The updates (aside from fixes) will be entirely user generated. Players will have an account they can log into online, and submit their weapon/armor/pet ideas, NPCs, and even quest schematics, all of which are subject to approval. Once they're approved, they go into the que for the next update.&#x200B;The quests are pretty much endless. The schematics given will be missing specific details that the AI will fill in like a madlib. A farmer could give you a quest to rescue their prize pig from a bunch of bandits, but some other player will get the same quest from the same NPC to rescue their favorite hen, or their stupid dog from a kid who stole it in the night, or a band of masked ninja mimes.&#x200B;Quests can also be randomized, specific to the NPC type. That same farmer can ask you to harvest his corn, or beets, or kill a basement full of rats or goblins. Gaining a certain level in a certain skill will trigger a new quest somewhere in the world, and the NPC quest giver will have a job somewhere in line with that skill, and the skill level will be needed to do the quest. Getting close to that level will trigger that NPC to mention a quest, but that you couldn't possibly complete it yet.&#x200B;Basically, you can be traveling around with your pet mini unicorn, looking for a fight with your elite level sock with a rock, wearing your best spandex and sombrero, when you get a quest from a merchant asking you to steal back his 20 bottles of tomato wine from a band of dancing werewolves, and deliver them to someone in the next town over...&#x200B;Everything user generated would start out with a few ideas from the developer, of course, but they'd get replaced by anything new that comes in. The quests could pile up almost indefinitely, as they are just text, while anything with a texture, like weapons would be rated by users (once in game), and replaced at lower ratings by newer additions to keep up a certain folder size.The practical application of this idea is that the game will be constantly updated even if the developer isn't actually doing anything more than approving other people's ideas.
 
Story ideas are not game ideas 
So many people post their story ideas here calling them game ideas.  * You're a superhero who turns into a supervillain - comic book/movie idea* You're a nazi officer who realises what's going on and becomes a rebel - movie idea* You're a robot in the future who uncovers the truth about robot society, that it's secretly being run by these things called humans - movie ideaThese are not game ideas.  They're stories.
 
Multiplayer game where the goal is to pretend to be a NPC whilst searching out other players. 
I’m imagining something like a mall filled with NPC’s walking around, shopping, chatting with each other, much in the same way that characters from Grand Theft Auto V do. You and 4 other players are thrust into this world and must try your hardest to blend in whilst still searching for the other players. The aim of the game would be to “tag” (or kill or disable or whatever) the other human players before they get you. In order to do this you would have to search them out whilst still trying to blend in yourself. Very casual game play in the beginning, basically walking around doing small things and doing some detective work, and then once someone makes a move all hell breaks lose!BONUS: once you do something that is too uncommon the NPCs will turn on you attempting to kill you or point you out to other players. 
 
A game entirely centered around microtransactions and pay-to-win except you can't use real money and instead play minigames to earn the money necessary to play the "real" game 
It doesn't matter what genre this game is - the conceit would work applied to all sorts of things.---An interesting mechanic, though, could be requiring the player to balance their time between playing the "real" game and playing the life/mini-games that get them their in-game "real" currency. Maybe they have to get or stay highly-ranked at the "real" game and taking time to sleep or "work" hurts them. So you buy the microtransactions in-in-game.
 
A bullet hell game except the only way to defeat enemies is to touch them. 
Even boss enemies go down as soon as you touch them; the challenge is to maneuver around their onslaught of attacks until you can get up close and finally tap them.Since you don't attack, all your characters' (or ship's) moves and specials are all about helping you avoid projectiles.
 
A detective game in which you can tamper with evidence, and the ethical dilemmas that arise from it. 
This would be an otherwise normal detective game with open-ended criminal/murder cases. The major difference is that you have the ability to tamper with evidence if you wish.Oftentimes, the cases will be tough enough that the player will have managed to barely fall short of gathering the necessary evidence to close a case. And the only way to make sure the suspect is found guilty is to tamper with some evidence. Just a little. Just for this one suspect who is clearly the real criminal.
 
Gamma Warp: A supposedly normal racing game that if you fast enough, you get warped into another universe 
Gamma Warp seems normal at first. You’re a 16 bit car traveling different landscapes, what can go wrong. But, if you go 200 MPH or higher for 5 seconds, you get warped into another, weirder dimension. Now, armed with a turret, you crash and burn through bizarre alien opponents, and try to go back to the real world
 
A game where you get to create your own ability 
This is a game idea i got from watching hunterxhunter (hxh), which is an anime/manga. In hxh the "magic" system of hxh is called nen and im going to simplify nen but there are 6 different classes. Each nen class boosts the power of your specific class. For example the enhancement class makes it so that you can strengthen objects and yourself. The Conjuration class makes it so that you can create objects.     While a enhancer can still create objects just as an conjurer can strengthen objects. Using nen you can create any ability as long as another class can do it, all except for one class the specialist class which has a unique effect for example predicting the future. Sorry for the poor explanation, if you wanna know more or just google hxh nen, but that´s all you need to know for now. So the idea for the game is kinda like hxh where you have different classes and you get to create your own ability. Now ill be honest this is where i got stuck because i don´t know how this would work inside a video game. But if i were to imagine it, it would work like, the, create your own class from call of duty. In Cod:B02 you have 10 points and you can create a arsenal of perks, guns etc. until the points run out. So the idea is that in the game you have all of these abilities that already exist and you can put points into healing, damage, size of the ability, strength etc. and you can select for example gravity which would just as an example cost 2 points out of 9 and then maybe you combine the gravity ability with a grenade which would cost 1 point so when the grenade explodes you can select whether you want the grenade to push or pull when it explodes 1 more point. So maybe you want the ability to pull so you select pull. So maybe you select another ability which would cost 2 more points, lets say fire and for that fire to do damage you put points into damage and for the pull to be strong you put the remaining points into strength. So now you have a grenade that when i explodes will pull anything that is close to it and then at the center of the grenade is a burning fire that will burn you. I feel like the possibilities are endless and that i think is the problem, because i don´t know how to put a limit to what you can do with the abilities. Because i imagined that this would either be a game where you fight bosses or a 1v1 pvp game. So i don´t know how to make the game balanced so that you can play against another player if i were to make it into a pvp game. I also don´t know how to make the game just right so that in a game where you fight bosses the bosses don´t become to easy or to hard. So the second imaginary option that i scrapped after thinking about this idea is that, so in hxh to activate your ability and to make it stronger you have to put certain restrictions on the ability. So maybe for example you can become immortal for like 15 seconds but your hp falls to 1. So the restriction for that ability is your hp falls to 1 and you can activate it whenever you want, but, it has a long cool down so you cant spam it. Maybe also you cant deactivate it while you are using it to save on invincibility seconds. So once you use it, its been used and you have to wait for the cool down to use it again. But i don´t know how to make this version plausible within a video game format at all because im letting people create whatever ability they want. Maybe a mix of these two options could work. Some backstory about me, i am 21 and at the age of 19 i was diagnosed with schizophrenia. So for the past two years ive just been stuck at home. I don´t want to share too much but because eventually my parents will die and i can´t go back too school or get a job due to lack of being able to focus and anxiety (and more reasons i just don´t want to overshare). So i thought about what i can do to make some money and video game developer came too mind, i have always played video games and for the past 2 months ive been trying to become a video game developer. I think this project is too big for me to do as a solo developer and a new one at that. So ive decided to post it here, because i do want someone to make a game like this even though i explained it imo very poorly because i dont really have a vision of how it would work. Now i used to think that this game would make me into a millionaire if i made it, but after playing around with the idea in my head i don´t think it would. However i do think that this game would be genre defining, because i googled on it and there doesn't seem to be a game like this. Maybe this game isn't even plausible, i don´t know. But if you do plan to make a game like this good luck. I might make a game like this but it wouldn't be anytime soon.
 
Plush Planet: A 1st person competitive multiplayer teddy bear video game for kids 
Feel free to use this idea.In this game, there can be up to 8 players.  Each person plays as a stuffed animal, and there are 8 to choose from: a teddy bear, rag doll, dog, cat, alien, goat, monkey and a duck.  The view is first person, the movement is 3d, and it’s open world.The scenery is completely plush. All the objects, buildings, the ground, and everything else is plush. It’s like a big teddy bear world.There are 3 games to play.  They are:Boing!     This is a bouncy game where everyone jumps around. The objective is to jump on other players’ heads.  You gain a point every time you land on another player. The height of the jump depends on how long you hold the jump button down. You can bounce off of walls too.  The player with the most points after 5 minutes wins. Bop!     In this game, every player has a nerf ball gun. It’s like laser tag, but with nerf balls. Unlimited ammo.  You earn a point every time you hit another player. The player with the most points after 5 minutes wins.Zoom!     This game is a race. There are lots of obstacles to jump over.   The course should take you through a plush city.In all of the games, players are ranked 1 through 8 at the end of the game. You can play against other players, or against bots. Players should connect to the server for competitive play. You can arrange a game with your friends, or be randomly assigned opponents.&#x200B;PS - Adults can play too, but there should be no chat feature for games where people log on and are randomly assigned opponents.  This will keep kids safe.  People that know each other offline can chat with each other in their private games, but that’s it.🧸
 
A Metroidvania game about exploring and then expanding the sphere of influence of a central town. 
It would take place in a world, not just one castle, and there would be other settlements you could take over after exploring other areas for the neccicary resources.
 
Reign of Death (Play as Villain) 
No idea what flair to put this under.This one is set in Modern times (2000-2020).Finally after centuries of sleep, you awake from your prison and have freed yourself! But the world has changed in ways you never expected... The world has forgotten. The world where real power ruled & struck fear into the hearts of millions has been reduced to mere myth. You will remind the world that you are no myth, and that they should NOT have forgotten. Thankfully your wardens have abandoned their duty, and all that remains of them is unbelievers. While it is kind of a relief, it does sadden you to know that even the descendants of your enemies do not know the truth, that they too have power within them. Oh well. At least there's a graveyard nearby... Soon the world will remember what it's like to have Death walk amongst them again. Idea:You're not a Vampire, you're not a Mummy, you're not long forgotten Warlock, you are representation of Death in Life; a Lich. You have untold & incredible power. But, being asleep for so long has taken it's toll, you only remember a few things: Aspect of Life - Disguise yourself as any living person. But you can't just make it up, you have to find someone, kill them, then claim their identity for yourself. It doesn't last forever, it will eventually begin to rot and fall off, so you should have "spares" available. Raise Corpse - The most basic. You just need to find a corpse, give it a kiss, and it will rise to serve your every whim. They typically don't make for good soldiers, but it's better than nothing. At first you can only control a maximum of 10. Eventually you'll be able to control hundreds.Siphon - Life is where your power resides, but you need to take it from others. You can choose to take it all, which will make them into a corpse, or you can take some, but not enough to kill your victims, they'll eventually regain what they lost, so if you hold on to them, you'll have your own batteries. Everything else, you've forgotten. If only you had access to all your powers, then you wouldn't have to slowly build up. The Graveyard will work for now, it has an underground crypt, which you can expand and form your own personal outpost, at least until you find a more permanent residence.For now, you're not strong enough to take on the world - you need to build yourself up. You need to find remnants of script, you hope that some of the ancient world has survived the decay of time.While your minions work on building your temporary lair, you need to venture out into the city, learn of this new world, this new time you've awakened into, and maybe, just maybe you'll figure out how to conquer it.Concept:You are immortal. You have powers. But the world has technology you're unfamiliar with. You can build a base, you can make yourself a laboratory, after finding books that peak your interest, you can make yourself a library & perform research (possibly find clues to the locations of components & spells you need), and eventually, you'll be able to make thralls (Living slaves under your control) and slowly but surely claim the world as your own. There's plenty that can be done. I haven't completely fleshed out this idea. But I imagine the right person could figure out how to make it a good long game. If you wish to use this idea, feel free to do so. I usually am able to unload a ton of ideas, but I've been up for almost 30 hours and can't think of anything else to add to it. And if you want to add more to this idea, feel free to do so with that as well.
 
Animal Crossing but with light RPG and dungeon crawler mechanics in a fantasy setting 
You're the king or queen of a small kingdom surrounded by a dark forest littered with endless dungeons that are filled with monsters. Every day you venture forth to find blueprints and parts for new buildings and decorations, castle upgrades, crafting mats, and armors and weapons. You rescue villagers and make them into your loyal subjects, building amenities for them and carrying out daily quests to gain their favor. As time goes on, you forge a bustling kingdom filled with loyal subjects for you to reign over from your castle.The main gameplay loop is running procedurally-generated dungeons to complete quests and obtain resources to improve your kingdom. It's one part Animal Crossing, one part single player MMO, with daily quests and tasks to perform in an open-ended, casual town builder.#Details* You start in a small clearing in the middle of a large forest. As time goes on you construct buildings, replacing the forest with a town, and gaining villagers either from rescuing them from dungeons or attracting them to your town through progression.* Game time is based on a 24 hour clock, meaning it's night in the game when it's night for you. Different types of monsters or resources might only appear at certain times of day or in certain seasons.* Daily dungeons are procedurally-generated maps that come in a number of different types/tilesets/layouts: crypts, caves, forests, ruins, etc. Different types of monsters from each type of dungeon drop different items, so you'll have an idea of which type you'll need to visit to accomplish different tasks within your kingdom.* The number of dungeons you can visit per day is limited by resources so that you can't just grind out everything in one marathon session. You need supplies to go on adventures, but you can only create a certain amount of them at a time based on finite resources that regenerate daily.* Daily quests and procedurally-generated quests -- your villagers occasionally give you one-time quests for tasks they need you to perform, usually by going to a dungeon to kill a named monster, to get items, or to craft something for them. There are also daily quests required to reach certain goals in the game such as gaining reputation.* Combat -- casual hack-and-slash, nothing too complicated or hardcore like Diablo or PoE. There are no parts of the game where you'll get blindsided by a powerful boss that one-shots you or overwhelmed by dozens of mobs. If you do die, you get resurrected back in your kingdom and lose the items you collected on that run, but you can go back to that dungeon and collect them again within a day, so all you're losing is time.* Open class system -- level up and choose any skill you want, but the build you choose is more based on fun and your own preference. Min-maxing is unnecessary since every build is viable (although not necessarily optimal or efficient). You can unlearn skills at any time by spending items or currency.* Itemization -- small bonuses such as +2 damage for a weapon, but with aesthetics also being a large consideration. There are many collectible armor sets and weapons.* Progression -- in addition to to the procedurally generated daily dungeons that automatically scale to your level, there are also one-time challenge dungeons that unlock as you progress. These are guarded by custom-designed bosses that are mildly challenging (you can't just spam them to death, you have to use some sort of strategy). These drop loot as well as some kind of exclusive upgrade that's important to the development of your kindgom (not yet sure exactly what).* The graphical style and general aesthetic -- cartoonish. Could be 3D like Animal Crossing, but it could also work with Stardew Valley/Moonlighter-style 2D graphics.* Outside of the RPG aspects, it has what you'd expect out of Animal Crossing when it comes to interactions with your villagers, life simulation, and kingdom management. E.g. maybe you could get married and choose a king or queen consort from among the villagers. Obviously a lot of your interactions would be tied into the items and materials you bring back from dungeons.#LoreIn contrast to the cartoonish aesthetic and casual game design, the lore is really dark.The entire world has been taken over by an endless, unnatural forest that has over-grown and destroyed everything, with all of humanity enslaved and imprisoned in dungeons. The remains of the old world (the crypts, castles, towns, etc.) are all now run-down ruins that have been taken over by monsters. The dead have been resurrected as zombies and skeletons, guarding their burial places as restless undead; the animals have been corrupted and twisted into vicious, dire versions of themselves; nightmarish monsters such as orcs and goblins have been made animate by the dark rituals of the Unmentionable One to be used as his foot soldiers.The Unmentionable One, who is responsible for this entire catastrophe, also cast a spell that made him immortal, but it was actually blood magic that also inadvertently enchanted a few other humans as well, including you. Just like him, you can be resurrected on an altar after you die, making you into essentially a god-king. As you beat back the forest and your kingdom expands outward, you create a growing sanctuary where monsters fear to tread because their life energy is bound to the evil magic of the forest. You alone can battle the forces of evil and forge a new kingdom where mankind can live in peace.
 
Stealth-story game where the story goes based on your stealth action 
Basically if you beat the mission stealth, the story progresses one way, if you beat the mission full on genocide killing everyone you see, the story turns out differently. Just a game concept idea i had
 
Expendable crewman space battle 
I was thinking about a coop game about being an expendable crewman in a large warship durring a space battle. The players' job would be to keep a ship at optimal fighting capacity during a space battle. The players would run around the corridors of the spaceship in FPS mode grabbing stuff from wall mounted dispensers and moving it to where it needs to be. When the crap hits the fan there will be jobs all around the ship from moving shells from the armory to the guns, putting out fires, hauling injured crew members to med bay, and repelling borders. The players' speed and ability to prioritize will determine if the ship makes it through the battle or not.There will be no external view of the larger space battle, but the AI captain will shout orders, give status updates, or warn of impending damage/ boarding action.
 
An RPG Where You Play As The Dungeon Boss 
OVERVIEW:What makes a good hero isn’t their looks, skills or equipment, but the villains they’ve beaten. But how do these villains come about? Simple, they become a Dungeon Boss. In this game, the fantasy world has less villains in it, just enough that knew problems are springing up for everyone and drastically changing the status quo in the worst way possible. To help fix this, an Imp from Hell who runs a bank offers you a once in a lifetime loan to become a Dungeon Boss. From their, the player can build and upgrade their dungeon, place traps, add loot and secret passages, place mini bosses and tests of endurances for heroes foolish enough to attempt it. At the same time, the player can send out raiding parties to villages, town and cities or lead them to gather more supplies, loot or to capture and place them under their banner. FEATURES:- Race: at the beginning, the player can choose to be one of several different monster species or humanoid race, each with their own pros and cons.- Locations: After choosing, the player’s dungeon is placed at a location based on what race they chosen. This, of course, can be changed with a small fee and significant Dungeon Level- Dungeon Level: As the player builds and upgrades their dungeon, their Dungeon Level will increase, allowing access to more room types and upgrades. This also will attract more adventures to explore it as well as minions who’d want to join. - Towns & Raids: To gain more infamy, loot and supplies, the player will have to raid towns and villages. Each town would be listed with different indicators from how big it is, how well protected it is and the quality of loot they possibly have. When the player starts a raid, they will only have a few minutes to go through and pillage the place, fighting back armies, guards and armed civilians. They can enter people’s homes and steal or force the residents to give the player their goods. They would have a few seconds though in each home and once they leave the place, it’s sealed off for the rest or the raid.- Heroes & Dungeon Crawlers: Part of the main game is having adventures discover the player’s dungeon and explore it. If one or a party does, the player can use traps and minions to slow them down or weaken them before they get to the final boss battle. If they defeat the player, the loot is restocked with what is in their reserves, the dungeon is given a rating along with the player and they are revived at the cost of their gold. But if the player defeats the heroes or they fail in the dungeon; same thing as far as ranking is concerned, but the player would gain loot, infamy and can choose to let the heroes live, execute them or try and convert them to become a minion.
 
A video game where you cheat to solve puzzles 
So I was watching a video by LGR about an action replay, and then I remembered a thirdparty Gameboy player addon for the PS1 called the Super GB Booster. Even though it ran Gameboy games really poorly it had cheat codes however the way you activated the cheat codes was really unique. Let's say you wanted infinite lives you had to kill yourself multiple times until it found a code that gave you what you wanted so what if you took that concept and turned it into a game. You would have to figure out how to activate a cheat code in a sort of cryptic way. So if you needed to fly you would find something that kept you in the air like a gust of wind.
 
One-Shot Man: A solo shooter where your gun can one-shot kill anyone, but, if you miss any shot, you die. 
On the walls, there would be a lot of "objects" that, when shot, would break and count as hit targets, so they wouldn't kill you.  These objects would be decreased in quantity to increase the difficulty of some areas.  IDK whether this should be 3D or 2D.  Also, this isn't an online multiplayer game.  It might work good as an endless arcade game (with power-ups?).&#x200B;To make the basic concept of this game would be Beginner difficulty, but to make complex enough A.I.and level design for the game to be fun would be Moderate difficulty.EDIT: If seems as though more details are needed.  I will say that you have the option of swapping out with a normal gun (also with infinite ammo) at any time.  This way, the HP of the enemies actually matters, rather than all HP being 1.  You might want to get strategic by using the normal gun on fast moving enemies, and the OHK gun on slower, tankier units.Also, I never want there to be a moment where the player feels safe, or like they have cover.  The A.I. should find you no matter where you are, and they would come in from all directions, so you can't retreat.  This is to discourage taking your time to aim and kill every unit with your OHK gun without any challenge.
 
A game where you have a beard 
You're a dude with a sword (if someone wants to play as a female, that's fine, but it has to be a female with a beard because I really like the beard graphic I made and it's non-negotiable) and there's an evil king you have to assassinate somewhere in the world. Whenever you fight one of his guards, before they die, they will attempt to save themselves by pointing you in the direction of their king. If you kill them, you don't get the information, but if you let them live, they'll go back to their fortress, heal up, get stronger, and come back after you for revenge. Each guard also has a randomly generated name so you can recognize if you're fighting someone you've fought before. I'm trying really hard not to be too influenced by Shadow of Mordor's nemesis system but it keeps trickling in.What I've got so far is a bunch of guards randomly placed throughout the world, a king placed somewhere randomly in the world, player movement, and the pointing mechanic. Basically, a guards HP gets below a certain level, an arrow appears over their head pointing to where the king's at. I also have a graphic for the player. He's a viking for now because vikings are pretty cool but that's subject to change if I get bored of vikings next week.At the moment, I'm just calling the game "Beard Game". Even though it's a perfect title, I'm open to title ideas.
 
An escort mission, but you're the one being escorted 
This is a little bit of a reverse-ideology for contemporary gaming tropes.The player is the one being safeguarded by their companion through the game/world. Enemies are too powerful for the player, or the player is too fragile (or small) The challenge? The player has to provide all manner of support for their protector, which includes finding ammo for them, giving them bark-like commands ("behind you!!" or "get down! Grenade!! ") or patching them up when they're down. Maybe even distract enemies.Basically you're playing as Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite, and your partner is Booker.
 
The player has found an imbalanced weapon. The GMs must stop it. 
Here's a game idea for a single-player action game that's set "inside" the meta world of an MMO RPG.The hero has found some too-powerful legendary weapon. It was never meant to drop. First other player-killers come for the hero to claim this weapon, but they serve as entry-level enemies that are no match. The GMs move in to enforce the item nerf. But they can't remove the item automatically so they must take it by force. They have powers above regular players (e.g. like Agents in the Matrix) but the hero can still overcome them with this weapon.Finally, the game's original designer must intervene as the final boss. The designer can drastically alter levels, summon in boss monsters, or delete entire zones.Playing with the 4th wall on issues like player agency, item ownership, game balance, etc. is ripe for a good story. The game rules and visuals could break down as the world is torn apart over this item. Anyway, it's just a story hook but maybe it'll inspire someone to a full game idea.
 
an animal crossing type horror game. 
so you arrive at a town, this town is entirely populated by anthropomorphic animals, gameplay would be something similar to these social simulation games, there would be no real time clock, more like one similar in length to stardew valley but you wouldn't have to sleep every night, but some things would be off, such as some buildings being closed at arbitrary times of day, for no discernible reason, not enough to be annoying but enough to make you confused, the villagers might let slip small clues to whats going on, slowly piecing together the truth, these clues will eventually lead you to special items and codes, and at the point in which you almost fully know what is happening you will be able to reach the finale of the game, by this point you know why you are here, you know what they want from you, and you wont let them take it, the final battle could use all the tools you are already accustomed too, if there is a battle, it could just all be in dialogue, but at the end, you leave on the same vehicle you came from. sorry if i left the most crucial parts out, i haven't figured out the plot yet i just know what the concept is.
 
Tunnelborne: A Sunless Sea Inspired Exploration and Trading Game 
Hello everyone! I'm currently developing a game with the working title "Tunnelborne" which will be set in a post-apocalyptic world where all of humanity was forced to retreat into an underground network of vaguely sentient tunnels. After a to be determined amount of years humans have colonized many key areas of the underground, and transport goods and people through the tunnels with a sort of maglev technology that isn't fully understood anymore. Point is: transportation doesn't require fossil fuel, which is too valuable to spare for anything other than critical power generation.Current planned features are:* Hex-grid based map with settlements in fixed locations that shifts the longer you spend at a settlement;* Reactive world that changes with or without player interference;* Fluctuating trade prices based on supply and demand;* Multiple friendly and hostile factions;* Ship and crew customization;* Storylines that span multiple generations and multiple characters.The world develops over a theoretically infinite amount of playtime, since it's technologically stagnant and the only developments are socio-economical. In practice there will be certain key events that can be triggered to effectively give the player a "game over" of sorts, allowing them to start over with a fresh world.Some of the biggest inspirations for this game are Sunless Sea/Skies, Kenshi, the Mount & Blade series and Dwarf Fortress (also Caves of Qud, to a certain extent).Thank you for reading, I wish you all a lovely day/evening!
 
An oddball game about being a socially awkward hitchhiker who keeps getting kicked out as soon as the conversation goes south. 
The gameplay is about dialogue, but instead of NPCs having to do most of the talking... **YOU have to do most of the talking.**The idea/theme is that conversation is actually quite intimidating for certain people, so this game would try to replicate that feeling for the player. To do this, dialogue would be handled unconventionally:During conversation, a soup of thoughts, pictures and words would float all over the screen. The player is tasked with selecting, ordering and pulling some of them down into a text box to make coherent speech. But the longer you take, the more *intrusive* words and thoughts keep crowding the screen. And of course there's also awkward silence the whole time you're doing this. Sometimes your character will just blurt out a word you put into the textbox before you finish, or worse... he'll just blurt out a word you shuffled around and now you have to work off of that started sentence.The more awkward or senseless the conversation turns, the more irrelevant and intrusive the thoughts that show up to choose from. Until eventually the driver is too creeped out by you and drops you on the side of the road. Now you have to hitch another ride and see how far they'll take you.*Where* the player is going isn't clearly revealed until you arrive when you beat the game. Part of the fun would be discovering the main character's backstory.
 
A mystery/puzzle game where you communicate/chat only with emojis and images 
The game interface looks like a chat app (like WhatsApp or Telegram).You have only 1 or 2 contacts to begin with, and you have only a few (2 or 3) emojis with which to communicate.The idea is that you can chat to these contacts using only emojis, and they respond only with emojis or with new contacts which are added to your list of contacts or pictures which are added to your gallery (e.g. photos of cute kittens, or a location or a crime scene). Once you attain these (because the contacts send them to you), you can start chatting to new contacts, communicate with new emojis and send different pictures.You are required to chat with your contacts to progress. (Each contact could perhaps be implemented as an AI / finite state machine).As you progress, you unlock more emojis with which to chat, and you are introduced to more contacts, and your gallery of images increases.The progression takes place by you finding the right combination of emojis and/or images to send in response to the chat - there could be multiple paths to achieve the same goal, e.g. if you laugh at something a contact says, they might take offence or if you show a sad emoji, you might gain their friendship, or whatever. If you send a picture of something, they might respond with more information (only communicated with emojis and images).Either way, the story could follow different paths and develop in different ways, making it very complex.There is some puzzle/mystery to solve through the game, e.g. you are supposed to reach a certain contact and get hold of a certain bit of information.The upside to this game is that it requires very few assets - there are freely available emoji sets.The challenge for you is to come up with a compelling story. For inspiration, why not look at the old game Captain Blood - in some ways the communication interface is a reminder of this one.
 
Ice Climber bullet hell 
This is a bullet hell game, but the bullets are boulders and sheets of ice falling towards your character as you climb a mountain. Unlike a typical bullet hell, you move very slowly and precisely. Your movement is direction is determined by \[W\] \[A\] \[S\] \[D\], but to move forward you need to hit your two axe's into the ice by pressing the left and right mouse keys. Balance maintaining your stamina by resting, and moving quickly through dangerous sections along the procedurally generated slopes. Hunker down and survive avalanches, storms, winds, rain, blizzards, icefalls, and ice melts to summit.
 
RPG disguised as a life sim 
So I just got this idea today.  An epic, space, lovecraftian RPG game disguised as a life sim, kind of like how doki doki literature club was a horror game disguised as a dating game. The game starts out calm, and quiet, with you meeting all of the characters and getting familiar with the area, before it gets all crazy. Some characters turn out to be alien lizards, the whole city goes on lock down, and it's all due to this weird, space/lizard cult that's trying to summon a monster of space and time. Would any of you play this
 
Post-Apocalyptic Gun Shop / Bar Basebuilder 
* Aquire military hardware, pharmaceuticals and useful accessoires, buy from and sell to adventurers and raiders.* Upgrade your bar with facilities like hotel rooms, casino, clinic to provide services. Watch your clients hang out on their best behavior.* Shop policies! Say yes or no to selling to bandits, use and sale of drugs and dangerous technologies. Might have consequences.* Adventurers leave to quest, loot, level, lose limbs, mutate, die and form fun adventurer groups.
 
FPS but you can't die, and neither can anyone else...unless they want to? 
Shot someone in the head? Their controls are now back to front until they can push their brain back into their skull.Shot them in the eye? They're now blind until they can find their eyeballs or anyone else for that matter, and slot them back into their eye sockets.Shot someone's arm off? Looks like they won't be able to carry or use any weapons or items. At least they can still move about and maybe dropkick you.Shoot a guy in the leg and watch him fall over. Shoot him in the other leg and see him struggle to get up again.You only win when your opponent has given up.
 
GotM: We want to realize a game idea every month 
UPDATE:Thank you for your interest! On Friday, March 15, at 16:00 UTC we will create a post here on /r/gameideas where you can submit ideas and/or vote on the ideas you like the most. The voting will be open that entire weekend. Stay tuned at: [https://macaronistudios.com/gotm/](https://macaronistudios.com/gotm/)&#x200B;Please share this with your friends - the more the merrier!\------Hello /r/gameideas!We are a group of Swedish game students that are starting up a small indie game studio called [Macaroni Studios](https://macaronistudios.com/). We are working on a concept we call GotM (Game of the Month), where the community comes up with a batch of game ideas and then put them up for a vote. The most upvoted idea is then realized as a mobile game by us, in only a month, and published on Google Play. Rinse and repeat, every month!Since the games are created in only a month, the game ideas must be short and concise, so not something like an MMORPG. Here are a couple of examples:* George of the jungle, in the city. George delivers pizzas, but everyone HATES George.* A vertical shooter where you cure diseases. With roguelike elements.* Climb to the top of a mountain by hardcore-praying to the almighty spaghetti monster.&#x200B;What do you think of this? We would love to get your feedback. If you like the idea, we will create another post where you can post game ideas and get the first round going!&#x200B;//Mickey, Frit & Emil
 
Open world game set on a Ringworld... and in space 
[https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ce/98/ee/ce98eec8f4643b2b863afd81da8cf6a8--stanford-torus-ringworld.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ce/98/ee/ce98eec8f4643b2b863afd81da8cf6a8--stanford-torus-ringworld.jpg)&amp;#x200B;So I have this idea that I'm having for quite a while now, that is basically about an open world single-player RPG style game that's set on a distant Ringworld in space (kind of like the one in Elysium for example) as for me, I consider myself a sucker for science fiction and Ringworlds in particular, and I'm currently reading the excellent "ringworld" series of novels by Larry Niven, which is where I take (some) of my inspiration from.&amp;#x200B;**PLOT**&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;The year is 2256, after humanity has completely drained earth's resources and was forced to move out of the planet and settle on Ring structures that were built and sent to various places in interstellar space and distant solar systems. Humanity had tried settling on Mars for a short period of time, but the lack of oxygen, extreme weather conditions and  large amounts of unfiltered radiation had pushed them back into open space, where humanity's greatest engineers built mega-structures that are basically "Ringworlds", and set them off to open space in search for a permanent home for their inhabitants.&amp;#x200B;**THE  WORLD/S**&amp;#x200B;The structures themselves weren't made to be a permanent solution for humankind, as they are exposed to the dangers of space and can only protect their inhabitants to some degree.  In the main map the players will be exploring, the structure will be like almost every other Ringworld that was created. It will have buildings, private houses, football fields, pools and lakes and small hills, just like on earth. It will have a modernized road system with electric cars and bullet trains for faster travel. It will even have small aircraft vehicles for those who can afford it, that are flyable within the ring. The population variety is pretty much equal in all parts of the ring, people are wealthy, highly educated and live together in communities. There are schools, universities, police stations and healthcare, shopping centers and everything else that's needed in order to sustain normal human life, just like on earth. Some of the rings orbit a nearby star if they're in a solar systems, while others drift in space in a direction set by whoever's in charge of the ring (yes, they can be maneuvered) some Ring structures are dedicated to farming and agriculture, and the population on them is rather small. produce made on these is later shipped to other structures via cargo ships.&amp;#x200B;**The protagonist and his lore.**&amp;#x200B;Our protagonist is Michael (Mike) Sierra. Like everyone else he was raised on a ring . He is 26 years old, and working in a special space agency called SSRA (Space Scanning and Research Agency) who's in charge of searching for solar systems and planets who might be suitable for human colonization. The agency itself contains many members, but each and every one of them is capable of working independently, and they all have their own spacecraft, gear, and weapons. Why would you need weapons? I'll get to that shortly. Michael's own backstory is rather simple. As he grew up he discovered that he was adopted, and his adopting parents told him that he wasn't actually born on the ring that he knew for his entire life, but on a different one, called NX70012 to be exact. This information wasn't of any use for him at first, as he loved his adopting family as if they were his biological one. However, when he tried to ask his father as to why he was adopted, he only received vague answers. Trying to trace the location of NX70012 didn't help him too much either, aside for learning that the ring's last known position was somewhere in the Operdemous constellation, probably near the overflow nebula. A communication network connecting between the rings had existed since day 1 when they were all built, but over the years some of the rings ceased communication for unknown reasons, including ring NX70012. Michael had spent some good years trying to track and communicate with the ring in which he came from, to no avail. He didn't even know why he was so keen to know the faith of his biological family, but he was still determined to find answers, no matter how scarce the clues were. Being recruited by the SSRA special agency later on, enabled him to expand his private searching of NX70012 and it also granted him access to powerful tools that allowed him to continue with his own journey, tools that "regular" citizens don't have any access to.&amp;#x200B;**GAMEPLAY &amp; MECHANICS**&amp;#x200B;The starting world is basically a 3D sandbox and it is fully explorable, GTA style. Players will be able to walk, drive, pilot, board the train and even swim in the sections that allow it. Both first and third person will be available, enabling players to immerse themselves in the world. NPC's will roam around the streets and neighborhoods, and players will be able to interact with them. Places of interest will be bars, pubs, restaurants, shops and many more, each have unique environment and characters the protagonist may encounter for his various needs. Michael owns a small apartment in a downtown area of the ring (which acts as the safehouse), but as the game progresses and players earn more money they'll be able to purchase multiple properties and even design their interiors however they want, from stuff they either bought or found. There will be a lot of jobs and side quests on the ring that help progress the story, but here comes the other part of the game – open space. Since Michael works for the SSRA, a lot of the activities he needs to take part in will be done far from home. He has his own spacecraft, he can refuel it, and he has to take care of it. The spacecraft can take damage, and fixing it is needed in order to guarantee safe operation. Spacecrafts can be bought later on as the players level up and unlock more skill points that in turn will allow them to purchase bigger ships and upgrade those by equipping them with better gear.Some of the missions out of the ring will include searching for radio signals and points of interest in different parts of space. Light speed travel will be available to the player under certain conditions. Discovered planets and bodies will be landable if the player has the right equipment, whether said bodies have or don't have any atmosphere. The players may encounter space pirates, who are basically regular humans who ditched their ringworlds, stole spaceships and set out to conquer space by robbing and threatening supply ships that travel between the rings. Locating wanted pirates and turning them in can lend the protagonist a nice sum of money, while killing them and blowing pirate ships to pieces can lend less money, and different stats (good guy/bad guy mechanics) Players will also be able to recruit an external co-pilot for some of the longer missions, which will act as a hired gunman too and can help during intense battles, both in space or on land. In some missions different characters will join Michael too. Michael's health could regenerate, but not always, and in some cases he may need to use special consumables in order to get back on his feet.There will be aliens as well, and they will have different races, but players won't know about them from the get go. The goal of the game is to progress over time, earn items and skills, level up and trace ring NX70021 along the way. My vision with ring NX70021 is that when Michael finally tracks it, the players will have to make a long journey in order to locate it and land on it, only to find that it was abandoned for years, and its inhabitants have all vanished mysteriously, which brings Michael to continue with his journey for his family.I have lots of other ideas for this game, so feel free to ask me about it and question everything.
 
An RPG where your abilities are based on how the world perceives you and what they believe you are capable of. 
An idea for an RPG or Action-RPG that revolves around how legends are born and the power of belief.There is no level, talent or skill system. You begin as a generic, year zero peasant... farmer, soldier, sheep herder or whatever with some sort of goal to go on an adventure and make something of yourself. You have basic movement options like running climbing and swimming, can wield and use weapons in a pretty amateurish fashion, can pick up and move or manipulate objects. Now as you progress throughout the game from this point you will be given opportunities to prove your worth, accomplishing feats of heroism or villainy. These may include things like saving a child from drowning, defending a merchant waylaid by highwaymen, scaling a dangerous peak, surviving a bad fall, etc etc. Depending on who saw you do these things and how you did them tales will spread amongst the townsfolk. These will began as rumors but become more real as time progresses and will define your key traits and skills.For example let’s say you save this merchant from bandits and you do so by stealthily using a bow to pick them off. The merchant reaches the city and hits the tavern where he speaks of the wandering adventurer who slew 3 bandits with a bow without ever having been seen. You are now naturally stealthy and make less noise when moving, or maybe you have a smaller silhouette and NPCs need to get closer to realize you’re there. But what if the merchant says you must’ve hit those bandits from something like 200 yards and doesn’t really harp on you being quiet? You now have less arrow drop using the bow, or your arrows travel much further and faster. Maybe the merchant says you hit each bandit directly between the eyes and it was a sight to behold. You now have ‘deadeye’ capabilities or natural auto-aim.I imagine there would be a sort of “telephone” type system for this where each little tale would be twisted and exaggerated as it’s told and spread. You could reinforce the skill by duplicating a similar feat and make it better. But maybe you mess up and fail something spectacularly? Like say you’re running about town and trip over an object. Now the story is “he’s a crack shot with a bow but man does he have two left feet”. You now develop a wobbly gait and are more prone to being knocked over, losing your balance or tripping. I’m still workshopping a lot of this and trying to sort out some fun ideas and example situations. Like if people stop talking about you, you’ll lose these abilities over time. My thought is that this would exist in sort of an early dark ages settings with some fantastical elements and couched deeply in satire. As the tales are stretched out and over embellished you gain ridiculous powers but they can also become ridiculous negatives.Maybe someone watches you fall off a building and barely survive hitting the ground. As the story is passed it goes from a 2 story building to a 4 story one and then to a tower. Enjoy doing super hero landing and not taking fall damage you jump off of something. The core gameplay loop would consist of you just trying to go through life and follow some sort of simple plot (no idea on story yet) while the actions you take and how you decide to play the game can only influence and not decide what abilities you get. If you decide to use your fists to do the talking you’ll see rumors revolving around your brawling ability but as to what those rumors are you’ll have very little input. It may be that you gain incredible endurance because you fought 10 men at once, might be that you get hands of stone because they said you were KOing everyone in a single punch. I have a general idea of a subplot based on all the gods in a type of Olympus looking down from on high and basically using you as a guinea pig for gambling and placing wagers on. They’d give little inputs to screw up sure things, or make you succeed in a one in a million shot.Let me know if this doesn’t make sense. Will update more after I sleep a bit.EDIT: I wanted to talk about progression a bit. There is a theory with the Avengers that reason they keep fighting greater and greater powers, and finding more and more enhanced villains is that there is a sort of cosmic force that balances out evil rising to meet greatness. In the MCU at least it starts with Iron Man fighting terrorists and another engineer who built a suit. As the universe expands so does the roster and severity of each event.I would use a similar system whereas your legend grows so too do the challenges grow to meet it. If you become famed for your skill with a blade you’ll begin to hear about a certain master swordsman who’s making his way your direction. He finds you and challenges you to a duel at sunrise to prove who the greatest fighter in the land is. This could be a recurring rivalry similar to Gary in Pokemon or it could be a primary antagonist and this is a fight to the death, cementing your legend and leading in to a natural retirement for your PC.You’re a famed monster slayer or hunter of beats? You’re no longer fighting particularly aggressive boars, you begin to encounter more supernatural or mythological type creatures. A wolf the size of the mill, a hydra or a thunder hawk is terrorizing a town nearby and you are tasked with bringing an end to it. This could lead to an eventual face off with a dragon, golem or something.I’ve been thinking of this in rogue-lite fashion where every play through is drastically different and the main plot may be just there to give you some direction and get you traveling about the world. So it’s fine to leave characters you’re not liking and just start fresh immediately. The end game goal would be becoming a true legend which would lead in to character retirement and an epilogue.
 
Detective game idea 
I am an independent game dev working on his first project. What I am planning is a detective game but unlike the generic puzzle solving detective games, this game will actually have the player look for clues to find the murderer. It would be in a visual novel format (like ddlc or ace attorney). Any ideas on how I can improve my game and make it a palatable experience? I am open to criticism.
 
I need help to improve my game. It's called Hold My Ale and it's an RPG with pen & paper mechanics. 
Hi guys,Since i was a kid i always wanted to create games and some years ago i had the pleasure to play D&D a bunch of times with some friends.For several different reasons i can't play with them anymore but i didn't want that the D&D flame die.In the beginning of the year i decided to make a game inspired in several childhood games and also D&D.This game is inspired in D&D, Ultima Online, Darkest Dungeons and Commandos.I'm adding some features i love in several video games like crafting, stealth and languages.&#x200B;For the interested players here is a break down of the future game systems and i would be glad if you can improve them with suggestions and new ideas. Keep in mind I'm a solo player and at anytime some of these systems could change or be eliminated. These are ideas for a dream game not necessary the final game.&#x200B;Pen & Paper[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPm753VwJTg&lc=Ugz9Abc8gUJ3zS2GtS14AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPm753VwJTg&lc=Ugz9Abc8gUJ3zS2GtS14AaABAg)&#x200B;Spells&#x200B;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_daGreQ2Tkk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_daGreQ2Tkk)&#x200B;CHARACTERS&#x200B;Characters will be adventurers or workers and they can be saved from the dungeonsAdventurers can be added to a party and workers can work in the player's house to craft several items or do tasks.&#x200B;\- Warrior (Adventurer): can use heavy armour and melee weapons (lethal and non lethal like needles with sleeping drugs)\- Mage (Adventurer): will be able to use different kind of magic (lethal, non lethal and stealth) and light armour\- Scholar (Adventurer): will be able to detect characters health, understand and teach other languages, identify characters likes, dislikes, weaknesses and strong features and he is the better communicator of the all characters \- Rogue (Adventurer): can arm, detect and disarm traps, use stealth, light armour and melee weapons (lethal and non lethal like darts with sleeping drugs)\- Ranger (Adventurer): can use range weapons (lethal and non lethal), medium/light armour and pets, can talk to animals&#x200B;\- Blacksmith (Worker)\- Carpenter (Worker)\- Cook (Worker)\- Alchemist (Worker)\- Tailor (Worker)\- Farmer (Worker)\- Miner (Worker)\- Woodcutter (Worker)\- Forester (Worker)&#x200B;ENVIRONMENT&#x200B;\- Outside and inside dungeons , quest locations \- Village stores and bank\- Player house with divisions\- Outside and inside resource areas&#x200B;&#x200B;CORE MECHANICS&#x200B;When a player enters a location he can choose fight, hide or befriend creatures.After enter a location the player will be in freedom mode and can use stealth or attacks (lethal or non lethal) like in a action RPG while not seen by any creature. After being seen the pen & paper turn based mechanics will be activated. In this mode the player can do several actions (major, minor and movement) in his turn like attack, move, talk, push and pull, equip and use items.When all the enemies are killed, befriended or avoided the player will enter in the freedom mode again and can got to other area, teleport resources to his house or receive crafted items.When all party members die the player will loose the items that are not in the bank or in his house but will keep the workers, house improvements and race friendship status (see below in friendship system).&#x200B;COMBAT SYSTEM&#x200B;Players can use deadly (the common melee, ranged and magic attacks from other RPGs) and non deadly attacks.Non deadly attacks will include freeze or make enemies sleep to give player an opportunity to befriend them.&#x200B;The combat will have pen & paper mechanics with dice rolling after the player being discovered by the enemy, stealth mechanics like Commandos and Desperados games while enemies didn't find out the player's presence.Players can also talk with possible enemies.&#x200B;The anatomy skill will provide players with the ability to give localised damage (head, eyes, ears, arms, torso, legs, etc...)Higher the skill more probability to give a successful attack in one of those target locations.This will increase the strategy of the game giving the possibility to slow down the enemy, make the enemy drop his weapon or shield, break some part of the armour, reduce attack damage from the enemy, increase attack damage from the player when hitting the enemies weaknesses (after identified by scholars)&#x200B;FRIENDSHIP SYSTEM&#x200B;Players will have an option to befriend rational and irrational enemies.To befriend rations beings the player can talk to them, do some quests for them or give them something that they like (Scholars will have to learn the language and have a skill to find out what are the enemies likes and dislikes)To befriend irrational beings, players will have to find out the items these beings like and give them to the enemies.If a player wants to befriend a being but he doesn't have the items needed he can freeze them or put them to sleep until they found the items and return to give them to the enemies.The race friendship status will increase each time the player befriends a being of that race, this will increase the chances of befriend other beings of that race.Befriended enemies can help players giving them items and useful information.The race friendship status will also be important to buy specific race resources for crafting.&#x200B;LANGUAGE SYSTEM&#x200B;Players can learn new languages if they have a scholar in their party.To learn a language scholar will have to read inscriptions and books located in the dungeons.After the scholars read books or inscriptions with all the letters of that language alphabet they can get a   language decoder from a carpenter. Player will have to decode the stone inscriptions and write the right translation below. When a player writes the right translation on the stone he will learn the language and will be able to talk to enemies, ear what enemies say before entering a room and translate what they say.Learning a language will be useful to use stealth since mages can transform in other creatures with the right spell but if those creates see the player's transformed mage they will ask him questions before let him pass, if the player eared the right conversations they can answer those questions.&#x200B;CRAFTING / BUILDING SYSTEM&#x200B;The player will start with a house with a small division (3 x 3 or something this can be increased over time) and a small piece of land to farm.Items can be bought from village stores or crafted in the player's house.Players can switch between dungeon, house and village views during the game.All the crafting items that players get from the dungeon could be teleported (while not in combat) to his house to be crafted by the workers. To teleport goods a teleport stone will be needed in player inventory and a teleport ank in each work division in the player house. Workers will then grab the resources and craft the item needed.House divisions can be bought and resized with money.To create an item the worker will need to have the necessary skill and it will take time to craft each item (I still don't know how i will deal with time in the game)To be able to craft weapons for example, the player needs to save a blacksmith from a dungeon and create a blacksmith room in his house with a teleportation ank and buy the necessary tools and benches for that type of crafting. The workers and adventurers will need Ale and food to keep fighting or working for you.Resource areas with common and uncommon resources can be bought from the one of the village stores.Rare resources can only be extracted from a cleared dungeon after a player build a teleportation ank in that room and assign a miner to that resource.&#x200B;STEALTH SYSTEM&#x200B;After players enter a map section, most of the time, they can choose to use a stealth strategy like Commandos or Desperados games.Only mages and rogues can use stealth abilities but both of them can also use these abilities on the other party members if they (mages and rogues) have enough skill.Rogues can became invisible or make other party members invisible (the amount of party members that the skill can be applied will be restricted).Mages can transform themselves in other creatures or the party members and talk to enemies to convince them to exit that room or even give items/information they need.Besides transforming the mage need to learn the creature's language from the scholar to be able to understand and give the right answer to the creature.&#x200B;I would love to know your ideas / suggestions and if this is a game that you would play.&#x200B;Follow the progress:&#x200B;Discord: [https://discord.gg/cW7efrV](https://discord.gg/cW7efrV) Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GamePuppets](https://twitter.com/GamePuppets)Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjmcTrxx--d\_7FqbnB4vV\_A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjmcTrxx--d_7FqbnB4vV_A)
 
Intergalactic horse race 
Hey guys,So the game is a serie of horse races. You don't control them, but you bid on them before each race. Since humanity as colonised a lot of planets, the horses are somewhat... Specials. Some have wings, others have fire breath, etc. They all have stats that you can access before each run. With the money you gain, you can pay to access to more informations for each racer and type of horses.In the midgame you can send teams on other planets to analyse some secrets stats from the horses, or more detailed ones (like the size in this specie give this acceleration, the number of eyeballs this top speed, etc).The game end when you finally encounter a "normal" horse which everyone bid on.Some variations could include building your own stable and breeding the horses, but it would be for a bigger game.
 
RPG where you're not the glorious savior of the world, just a fashion-conscious girl who would *literally kill* for the trendiest designer dresses. 
Instead of armor you have enchanted clothes whose various aesthetic properties affect your ability to fight monsters. Each monster has a different sense of style and some of them find your look so glamorous that they get enraged with envy and start making mistakes - others are so in awe of your beauty that they are paralyzed staring at you - etc. (Instead of weakness to fire and slashing damage, perhaps some monsters have a weakness to flapper girl outfits and passive aggressive remarks?)You gain experience not simply by killing monsters - but by looking stylish, classy, and graceful while you do it. There may also be Sailor Moon style anime girl power posing sequences as spells granting you various temporary benefits like haste etc, complete with cheesy-sounding but catchy songs.Oh and you have a cozy cottage next to the ocean that you can decorate with antique furniture, wall hangings, etc stolen from dungeons.I may need to make this game solely so that I can play it myself.
 
A scary way to have a diving suit. 
Imagine working underwater and having to go outside to repair something or to take samples, a scary way to impliment this would be with no visor. The way this could work lore wise is that you are in too high pressure of an environment and the suit has "vision" by sending out intemittent sonar pulses. This would be creepy in a way that you think the path is clear then something just pops up on the next sonar pulse.
 
Just a list of game ideas 
A kart racer with super powers that charge up instead of random items, every character has their own super powers and there are secret short cuts for some charactersA rogue like/RPG/Life sim game where you go to school or go to your job, learn a couple of things, get materials, hang out with your friends, and then on the weekends you try to safe the world for about 30ish minutes before you have to go back homeAn rpg that doesn't have exp and instead has really complex machines and a strong Risk vs Reward battle systemAn online game where you get assigned a role, Father, Mother, Brother or Sister, this game takes place during a nuclear fallout and you have to kill other families to steal their materials and keep living, this game takes place in the 40's and is called Nuclear FamilyMore platformers in general, they don't even have to be full platformers, maybe something like Doom Eternal where you do platforming in-between shooting peopleI want a subspace emissary type game where all of the characters are from different fancies but the gameplay is built around a single player experience and the developers will only have to worry about like 16 charactersA new Kid Icarus game, or show, or another 5 minute short on Nintendo's YouTube channel, I'll take anything
 
Lighthouse" an RPG about loneliness. 
RPG/Adventure 2D game, camera preferably like Zeldas camera.You try to reach a lighthouse in the distance to find civilization, as you are all alone, you go through a great adventure, with you talking to yourself, with awknowledgements of insanity, depression, thoughts of suicide. All you have is a relic of your past, a rusty old shotgun with a barionett, the combat is supposed to be closed in to feel the essence of fighting, no one should be a villian , there is no black and white, only gray. You find weapons, and armor, you see overgrown cities, making you remember the past. In the end you accept that civilization is gone, and that you are alone.Combat should preferably be in the open world like Zelda, not like Undertale. That is it, hope you can find a good way to make it a real thing.
 
Immersion in game development. 
As I always say, immersion goes far beyond graphics. Having the best graphics does not mean having immersion. The immersion that I speak is like entering a castle of terror, because it brings you emotions, good or bad. It is immersion that holds the player in the game. It's like not wanting to go out to eat, or do anything else, you just forget you're playing a game. Everything is connected in the setting and theme. If this set of quality adds to the multiple challenges proposed in the game, you already have a big difference, just look at the number of games that are repetitive. Things that take us out of the reality of everyday life, are more likely to cause us emotions.Immersion is emotion. As I always say, if the game doesn't bring you emotions, for me it's not a good game. This is noticeable in the first 5 minutes of the game. If you are developing a game, take this test, film the friends or relatives who are going to play your game first. Study their reaction. See if your game is being very specific for a single niche of people, if that happens, sometimes it is better to dose your theme a little so that the game is not so restricted. This does not mean that you will lose the essence of your game, just that you will add elements that will attract a larger audience and generate more elements to complement your game immersion. Never forget to attract people by immersion, using art and challenges as the main elements of your game.
 
A new video game where you play someone with no skills and no weapons. The object is to get killed as fast as possible while a heavily armed badass tries to protect you. Call it "Escort Mission 
 
Hockey is a genre not currently being served 
Basically title.  This sport is loved by so many people and ice physics are a fun mechanic.  Yet, no indie has really picked up the torch from the early 2000's NHL games.  That's a long time for a genre to be under served.  Sure, getting the license for the NHL teams is out of reach but an approach like Super Mega Baseball could work very well.  I'm tied up in my current project otherwise I'd be all over this.
 
A strategy game where the aim is to keep the war going so you can sell your weapons and keep making money 
Would have an interface similar to plague inc.
 
Why isint there a John Wick Game, it would be amazing 
 
A sidescroller that’s only one level but the level is insanely long 
There seems to be a rise in sidescrolling games with the sole purpose of being rage inducing and irritating. So, I came up with my own idea.The game is only one level long, but the one level is insanely long, at least a couple hours. There would be certain towns or stuff spread far and few between just to keep it interesting and to get certain items. Boss battles would happen while the character is still running through the level.Death would set you back to the beginning after your health reaches zero, unless you have a specific item bought and one of the before mentioned towns. There’d also probably even be some side quests and characters you could help along the way that could help you with your goal(teleport you ahead by 2 minutes, making enemies slower, etc.).  Of course each character, enemy and boss would have its own unique design and element to keep the game interesting, and maybe there could even be a sidekick system where you can have a follower that buffs you. The protagonist’s objective for reaching the end of the level, I don’t know yet. Probably something mediocre that would piss off anyone playing the game, lol.
 
Programmer with no art and music Skill 
Im a programmer with no art skill / music skills. Im looking for either an idea for a game that would work without art and music or artists and musicians. Im doing this just for fun tho so I dont have any money to spend on a project.Im also open To join an ongoing project.I mostly code in C# so Unity or any other free Engine that works in C# is fine.
 
Attack on Titan meets clash of clans mobile game 
You could build your own village and create walls/Traps/ buldings and have anti armor titan cannons/artillery or scouts with odm gear to defend against attacks from other players. Maybe even have heros similar to Archer queen and barbarian king and instead use Mikasa or levi etc). While attacking you could use regular titans and the different 9 titans. Imagine high lvl base raids with a collosal or beast Titan to destroy walls and flooding there villages with abnormals. Obviously this is just a thought but the possibilities would be endless. How is this not already a game? Its the perfect clash spin off
 
The AntiMage 
So I've been mostly without sleep for the passed 3 or so days. I used to have all these great and fantastical ideas that could have been extremely good games as a kid, but as I've gotten older, my creativity has kind of gone away. Today, though, on almost 36 hours of little to no sleep, it's back in full force. I want this game in my head to be reality, but I haven't the know-how to make it happen. Let me lay it on you. Do keep in mind, the entire idea is still in infancy, and I'm only just fleshing out the BEGINNING of the script. My expertise is in writing, so this may just turn into a book, but I want it to be very decision driven.   BASIC PREMISE: You are an antimage, an elite military unit designated to fight witches and warlocks in humanity's war against mages. The entire game is revolved around 2 things - an excellent story, which I am currently hammering down, and combat fluidity. I envision it would take HEAVY combat influence from Dark Souls and The Witcher 3. During fights, you will need to think about the environment - not only how it will affect you, but how you will affect it. Collateral damage to farmland, structures, roads, etc. will lower your already lowly reputation, as the common folk mostly see you as part of the mage problem. From time to time, you may encounter non magical humans who may want to assault/kill you. It is up to you to find non-lethal ways to dispatch them, or to slaughter them senselessly and face the associated consequences. PLOT: You're being sent South to your nation's capital to track down and kill Sage, the leader of the mage resistance. Along the way, you will meet Godfrey, your handler, and Rosric, a representative of the merchant's guild. (As well as a myriad of other characters I haven't fleshed out yet) Along the way, you'll find that this war has blurred battle lines, as it seems that mages, witches, and warlocks have penetrated deep into the nation's lands. Sage himself is in the city planning something BIG. It is your job it either stop it... or perhaps to join him. ENEMIES: As an Anti-Mage, your job is to kill witches and warlocks. These are extremely high power mages that have taken in so much mana they are barely human anymore. Normal mages are not your duty to kill, but you may find that collecting bounties on them may fetch some coin. Unlike a normal mage, witches and warlocks will all have unique abilities, all of which must be accounted for before engaging them. These powerful enemies may increase the chance of a battle having collateral damage, which is something to look out for. An example is I've already heavily fleshed out a witch who uses her own blood as a weapon. Mid way through the fight, she will sprout wings made of blood and become capable of a wind attack that can blow structures over. There will also be a myriad of magical creatures to hunt, as the empire doesn't like magic existing right under its nose. These will range from Dragons to cats with illusionary capabilities.WEAPON SYSTEM: You are an anti-mage, which means you are bound to a magical relic that you use to fight. In this case, it's a pair of gauntlets that can fire spearheaded chains made of shadows moderate distances. They also make excellent melee weapons. As you play, you will unlock new techniques. Just as well, defeating Witches and Warlocks will award you with a rune which you can take to an arcanist to forge into a runeplate you can put into one of your gauntlet's 2 rune slots. These runes will fundamentally modify how the weapons work or the capabilities of the weapons. Example: I've fleshed out an earthen rune which will allow the player to use the shadow chains to pull up sections of the earth to use as shields, or to throw enemies off their feet. COMBAT: The entire game is built around the combat system. As stated before, I envision the combat to be similar to Dark Souls/The Witcher. What will set the combat here apart is acrobatic capability and of course, high-impact environmental destruction. When against a Witch or Warlock, a player should feel as though they are evenly matched with them, and that a decisive strike from either party would kill the other. I haven't quite thought about what happens if you die. Probably load back to whatever autosave you were previously at. So, I think I got everything I want to post here for now. I'll conclude with some problems with the idea:\> I do not know how to code/animate/really anything related to game design. I'd be down to write/creatively direct this project, but it's kind of dead if I couldn't get the resources to make it happen.\> The combat system in my head is incredibly complex, and I'm not sure players would take to it all that well. It would be up to a dev team to simplify the controls as much as possible without losing gameplay. \> Environmental destruction is important to the idea, however some may find it frustrating, and the technology available may not like it. There is is! Any encouragement/criticism of the idea would be greatly appreciated!
 
A "build your own troops" kind of strategy game 
First of all this is a huge project, but I have to clear my mind a bit so I'm writing it down. So I don't know if any of you have played a flash game called battlecry. I played it a lot when I was around 15 years old.Well in short it just evolves around the idea that you have a certain amount of points per level. The points are used to create soldiers by giving them equipment or traits from 5 categories, Race, Armor, Weapon, Offhand (shields and dagger ect.) and Special (which was like mounts and magic stuff).Every item had a different cost of points, and the soldiers cost was just all those points added together.For example you made, let's say, an Orcish bowman with plate armor. And named the soldier type "the gren guard" or something epic like that.So Orc 5p +Shortbow 4p +Armor 7p =16p1 green guard cost 16p and 10 green guards 160pI'm thinking of implementing the same kind of "Build your own army" -mechanic with the kind of 3D battles known from something like the total war -series.  Custom battles would be set up by deciding the amount of points for each army.Then having 10's or 100's of custom made soldiers battling against each other.It could even have some kind of a campaign or anything.
 
A game where you're at the end of a zombie apocalypse and you have a job to clear out infected buildings. 
**safe house and missions**You have a safe house where you can manage soldiers and their equipment. This is also where you browse the city map and choose buildings to descend through. Consider your needs for the mission. In need of medical supplies? Choose a hospital building. In need of weapons and ammunition? Choose a police station. When departing, you will be taken via helicopter and dropped onto the roof of a building. Then you begin your descent. **soldiers**I haven't given thought to a maximum number of soldiers, but up to 4 can go on a mission including you. You can actively control 1 and the other 3 will be ai. If a soldier dies they are lost for good. If all 4 soldiers die, you lose their equipment as well. When recruiting new soldiers, they will have only a pistol to start with. If you get more than 4 soldiers, you can send the extras off for a completely ai controlled mission. When you complete a mission that will pass some game time required for the ai missions to complete themselves. **checkpoints**I'd go with procedural generation for the kinds of buildings in the city and the building interiors. Towards the end of a floor, there should be stairs or an elevator to go to the next floor AND a window that is not boarded up. Using some kind of signal flare will let you signal a helicopter to pick you up or get more supplies (send a soldier home / get another in his/her place, get more ammunition, etc). You can choose to take everyone home from there and the building will reset. You can leave 1-4 soldiers behind to keep that point secure so you can return later (assuming it's a good randomized location that has yielded many supplies!). I also had the idea to allow players to take a crowbar with them, to pry boards off a window for an emergency checkpoint. Haven't given much thought into balancing that or if it would be more fun to allow any random window in the place to be opened and signaled from. Maybe you barricade a room because the building is swarmed and you aren't prepared - find a window in that room and you can extract your crew and go do an easier mission.**misc**I'd say the number of systems involved make this a project for a group of amateurs or 1 intermediate dev who knows a game engine really well. I'd love to make this game myself but it's been in my idea book forever. Game could work as either 2D or 3D. I didn't have many ideas for a story but for the sake of some kind of satisfying progression, maybe when you secure a whole city you gain some kind of passive bonuses and can then move on to another city. So we have infinite replayability and small bonuses for each completion. 
 
We've seen shooters in which ammo is currency... but how about one in which ammo is LIFE. 
In a way, your ammo is your health bar.To be more specific, whenever you take damage you lose ammo. Having no ammo puts you in a critical state in which any hit will kill you.The twist is that this all applies *per your current weapon's magazine*. If you took a big hit, you can reload to put yourself back in "full health" so to speak... *assuming you still have ammo for it*. Or you can swap to another one of your four weapon slots to essentially switch to that weapon's health pool.### The rest of the game's design is focused on health/ammo management under duress.Enemies drop ammo when they take damage and the drops disappear very quickly. This forces players to stay active and in the "danger zone" at all times. You only have four weapon slots, all available at the press of a button, which lets you better manage four different "health" pools.Each ammo type has unique properties. For example, magnum ammo is unique in that you only lose one bullet per hit of damage no matter how heavy that damage was. This makes it better for taking a huge single hit compared to an SMG, whose ample magazine size and fast reload often make it better for tanking damage.There can be a railgun with the unique property of going through multiple enemies, so you'll strafe around monsters to line up that shot. Or a Tesla Coil gun that can zap multiple enemies, so long as they're close enough to each other.And if you're all out of ammo on every weapon, at the most desperate of times, you'll have no choice but to rely on your weak melee attack to extract more ammo.This concept could work as either a 2D top-down twin stick shooter or a 3D first person shooter. But in my head I see it as a ~~ray-traced~~ raycast Doom style retro shooter.
 
What do you think of my idea for a tower defence in 3d, towers have spherical radius and enemies can move up, down, left and right? 
I'm in the early stages of making a 3D tower defence - the map would be a cube (like the inside of a rubics cube) with start and end in opposite corners.Towers could be placed anywhere in the cube and towers would use a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest route.Any suggestions or ideas or feedback at all welcome. Thank you.
 
need game idea 
i need a beginner game idea, but im really picky. I havent found anything i like so pls help. i have made pong, flappy bird and other very beginner games so i want a somewhat big but easy game to make.(edit)thanks for all the feedback :D
 
Zombie Survival without weapons? 
I don't know if this concept already exists but...A zombie survival but there won't be weapons or anything that would resemble it. The gameplay would most likely rely on stealth, misdirection, strategy, and a lot of running.The player would play as a tourist carrying common backpack items. The experience would emphasize in the uses of mobile phone.GOAL:The ultimate goal is to reach the location where the rest of the survivors took shelter. Problem is, it would not be marked in the map.There would be a trail of clues in the form of radio announcements, online posts, pamphlets, graffitis and/or unreliable rumors from NPCs.GAMEPLAY:There would be a typical day and night cycle where zombies being more active at night while sluggish and disoriented at day.There would be health, hunger and fatigue but not to the extreme. The player must secure atleast a single food item in the middle of the day and before nightfall.Skipping meals is possible but would affect health and fatigue. Fatigue is built up through walking and running and primarily replenished by resting and sleeping. Such actions would consume time and it would be wiser to rest/sleep in safe locations. The player may get cold/fever when Health is low especially when resting/sleeping outdoors or exploring under a bad weather.Electronic devices would require charging. The mobile phone can be used to access the map, the social media and the internet, and can be used for distant communication. It can also be useful for application tools such as flashlight, radio, calendar and (saving and loading) journal. In addition, the player can use the camera to capture images of clues in the surrounding.That's all. Thanks.EDIT: Thanks for the comments everyone! Regarding the "no weapon" part, I really didn't consider why and just focused on the mechanic of using an electronic device. I agree it would be logical to use a weapon so maybe let the player pick one then force them to face a charging crowd. Zombie survival without weapons sure is hard to reason out but its a good reason to make a game with such mechanic.
 
A kingdom-building game where the choices you make build the kingdom, but only indirectly 
I can imagine this as being how it would actually be as a monarch of a nation. &#x200B;***Concept*** You start with a tiny little kingdom. You are asked to make decisions about the kingdom, from simply binary choices (do you want to build a granary or a smith to utilise the waterwheel?) all the way to massive, kingdom-defining decisions (are we going to prepare to be a warfaring nation, or, are we going to focus on more economic interests, or, are we going to become the diplomatic middle ground of the local nations?). Every aspect is controlled by the player, but only indirectly, through advisors. The kingdom grows physically, economically, and culturally under the weight of these choices. Many wrong choices could lead the kingdom into turmoil - there could be a total collapse, or even a revolution leading to the player being thrown out of the palace, French Revolution-style.&#x200B;***Idea Size*** There is a lot of scalability here. You could have very simple graphics (basically a colour-coded map), all the way to fully rendered, beautiful graphics. The game idea is dependent on the story the player creates, rather than the graphics of the game itself. I think that the writing would take a long time in this, as potential outcomes of the choices will make or break the game, so every choice and it's outcome will need to be carefully considered in the design phase. &#x200B;If it does get picked up, I would like to help out where I have time, and I would like access to alpha and beta phases to help test the game. A post-release copy would be nice, too. 
 
You know the future because the narrator tells your story, which freaks people out 
Imagine if the narrator was telling a story and your character was the only one who could listen so people would think he has some kind of super power.Like you are talking to someone and the narrator goes like "This conversation could have gone differently if [main character] knew that [this guy] was cheating on his wife". Then boom, you can use that to blackmail the guy.Or maybe you have to attack a super fortified castle but the narrator reveals the existance of a secret passage and then the guys of the castle are like "wtf how did he knew about this?!"It would be a bit like stanley parable but as an RPG.EDIT : I didn't properly explain the idea. The narrator doesn't have any interaction with the player. He talks about him but he doesn't talk directly to him like in the stanley parable. The character can hear the voice but to him, it's just like an ability to see in the future, that manifest itself in the form of a voice narrating his adventure.For example, in a dialogue, the narrator says the player is about to confront the person he is talking about something. That's how the player learns about that something and can confront the person about it (that's a paradox). But the player can also hold that information and keep it for later or never use it at all and in that case, the narrator narrates a different outcome.
 
Police department management sim 
**Overview:**A game where you play as a police chief making decisions that affect the department and community.**Gameplay:**I'd start out with it being a mobile game, then port it to PC if there's enough interest. You'd have 3 main departments to choose from:* College Police Department - Small, easy to manage. Limited room for growth.* City PD - medium-sized, room to grow, more funding. Can be challenging at times.* Sheriff's Office - manage the jail in addition to patrol. Lots of flexibility, but positive public opinion is essential for reelection.(There would also be State Patrol and Federal Agency as secret bonuses that unlock when you finish the other 3.)You'd be able to set the crime rate (violent/property crimes could be set independently of each other) and population. Then, it changes over time based on your decisions. You start out with a bare minimum number of officers per shift (dependant on population) Dispatch is contracted out, eating away at your budget. As the community grows in size, it's up to you to recruit and hire more officers. Your new officers start with possible hidden traits. They could be skilled at investigations... or exceptionally lazy. They could be fast runners or be at risk for alcoholism. Hire a police psychologist to screen your applicants, or take your chances. Increase your officers' fitness by requiring fitness tests, but you'll get fewer qualified applicants as a result.And that's just the start. As your department grows in size, you could hire dispatchers, investigators, and other staff. There would be special units such as K9 and helicopter pilot. Morale and public opinion must be managed if you are to be successful. Paying your officers more can increase morale, but might make the public think you're being wasteful. Cracking down on rulebreakers looks good, but would lower morale. If public opinion dips too low, citizens lose trust of the police. They're more likely to run from or fight your officers, and less likely to offer anonymous tips.  Riots can even break out, and funding can be cut off.If morale gets too low, officers would quit, go on strike, develop addictions or even commit suicide (yeah, maybe that's too dark.)Random events would happen that require strategy. A few examples:* Neighboring department goes on strike. Do you send some of your officers to help? Lowers morale, but gives bonus to funding and public opinion. * One of your officers was involved in a shooting. The state determined it was justified, but the public isn't happy. Reduce staffing until it blows over, or take the hit to PR?* A confidential informant offers information on a high-ranking gang leader. His intel may be faulty and the confrontation could turn violent quickly. Is it a risk worth taking?----------That's just a summary. I haven't started work on it yet, just want to know what everybody thinks. I've played prison architect before, but wanted something more focused on policing.
 
Short and Sweet: SimCity but its a Blade Runner City 
 
Ghost of Tsushima inspired Aztec game 
You play as an independent tribesman during the ancient times of mesoamerica. The Aztec empire invades your home during a flower war to take your people to use as sacrifices. The game follows you as you free your villages and cities to ultimately kick the Aztecs out of your home.
 
“The Guy In The Chair” - a game where you play as the hero’s “guy in the chair”, bringing up information, schematics, coordinates, hack security systems, disable power grids, etc on the fly as your heroic counterpart fights the big bad. 
You work for a sort of superhero call-center that provides as-needed support to the various super heroes of the world. As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.For the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). For the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.For the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.The interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.You would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.There would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.All from the comfort of your chair.
 
Game suggestion/idea about bosses 
What if the developer of the game makes a boss and if said player defeats that boss, the player would become “cursed” and become the very boss they defeated.Because players are driven by human input and not AI it would become significantly interesting fight with a greater reward, but if the player boss is not defeated in a certain time frame the “curse” lifts and the player who was the boss gets the reward.I would love to see some games implement this one of a kind game mechanic idea.If there is any other redditor who wants to add to this idea feel free to add to this.
 
A ninja game, but you have to pay for the damage you cause to objects. 
You're a ninja, and you have to get from point A to point B sorta like the original Ninja Gaiden games, but stage objects break a lot easier, and at the end of a level, the total cost of the damage is calculated, and you have to pay for it with the money you collected. If you can't pay for it, you have to work a part-time job, in the ninja outfit.
 
A top-down melee game where you play as a soul of a necromancer and use various dead bodies to retrieve your own body from the god of death. 
The game would be a single player top-down, set up in 2D pixel art with a focus on dark palette and murky mood. The world is kind of medieval times where any act of magic etc. is considered a heresy.You've obtained a power to resurrect the dead which isn't cool for a God so he has split your soul and body and sent a bunch of priests to take and sacrifice your body in the act of the revenge.Your default form is "soul" and the NPC's can't see you. You can use dead bodies to jump into them and become vulnerable to the world. In your soul form you're vulnerable to the God's power and his forces.There are various of dead body types you can use on your way to retrieve your lost body.  EDIT: Btw I'm an indie developer and would really like to hear your opinion and what would make such a game more unique and interesting to a potential player. It's still an idea, I haven't started working on it. But who knows.
 
IDEA: A space-survival game that takes place on a single abandoned space station in the middle of a vast void of unknown outer-space. (warning, long, super long, post) 
(In advance, I want to make this an actual game one day, when I become more experienced in programming, so please don't copy the major theme of this game if you could. Of course I can't stop anyone so credit me if you do anyways. Thank you!)  The game starts out by showing vast, moving shots of nothingness. Nothingness in space though. It's just an infinite void of stars and darkness giving off a deep malice. On the last shot, it shows a small hunk of metal floating around in this void. It looks miniscule compared to the emptiness. The camera slowly zooms in on this space junk reveling it as a small space station, almost small enough to be mistaken for a large, square\~ish ship. It is beaten up, torn up, some parts are smashed, and others are even missing.  There is no sound yet, until it cuts to a shot of inside the space station. Where you (or your team if you do multiplayer or co-op) are wounded and wearing damaged space suits. The advanced tech, although beat up, implies this game takes place in the future. You all get up. nauseas and disoriented. You don't immediately get anything like a task or a quest until you interact with a broken terminal as sparks fly out of it. It barely works but it manages to stutter out some information  *Station: 629;  Vulcara. Welcome, Captain*  *Hull integrity: Severe Damage*  *Energy Production: None*  *Shield Status: Offline*  *Weapon Status: Offline*  *Fuel: Offline - Thrusters: Offline*   *Gravity Control - Online*The only thing that is working is the gravity control, allowing you to walk normally in the station. It appears the station name is Vulcara, and it's designation is 629. The terminal has a few options, including Logs, Status (again), and mechna-arm control, and repairs. The Logs reveal you and your crew used to have a much bigger space station. The space station also worked as a space-ship that was launched into space. Many logs are missing and you are not sure why you have been stranded, where your crew is, and why you were launched into space. Now using the mechna-arm control, you can control a large and expandable robo-arm on the outside of the station. It is also badly damage and doesn't extend much.   You see a metal box surrounded by much debris that you can just barely reach with the mechna-arm. When you grab it the arm retracts to the inside of the station and within a few second it is now in your hands. Inside the box is a gun and a futuristic looking tool. Inserting the tool within the terminal allows you to build new parts to the ship, or you can use the tool with the repairs section and fix pieces of the ship.  Using the mechna-arm you can grab the debris and fix the ship. You can use the tool outside of terminal to fix items inside the ship, using this you know have a repaired hull (of what you do have) and a working terminal. A UI appears showing health, thirst, hunger, and effect.  So for the rest of the game it's you trying to make it back to Earth. Doing this is a dangerous task, you need to build new parts to the Vulcara and keep a steady supply of energy, fuel, food, water, and make sure the parts of your ship is always up to standards. You can build station attachments like more generators, weapons/turrets, more thrusters (will be required for heavier ships), and other things like radars. You can build labs to study aliens and ores, and better ores make better things.  You can build terminals and rooms for things like navigation, farming, weapon/ammo building, etc. You will have to land on planets that you come across (when you build the shuttle) and collect water/hunt alien creatures for meat. You can also mine on planets or mine meteors. There would be many other features, like upgrading attachments, terminals, weapons, and the ability to craft better and more advanced gear and suits. Your station will be attacked by space creatures known as "anomalies" and a good radar and can tell you what parts of space and which planets are more dangerous, but the more dangerous, the better the minerals, loot, and food quality. There's even a very hard to fight boss called "The Queen" which is a massive planet sized anomaly that gives you lots of good loot and a secret ending, if you meet the requirements. You can even find and travel through worm-holes (at the expense of some hull integrity.) There's a lot to do in this game, explore, craft, fight, mine, upgrade, study, etc. The story/lore is never full explained and will require you to upgrade the main terminal to unlock more logs and restore more logs using your lab. many of the logs have  accompanying cutscenes. Some lore is even seen through alien studies from alien settlements (which can be found! Although not all are friendly.)  The game also has an endless mode that you can choose at the star or you can choose when you find Earth. (Like it implies, the game doesn't end, or keeps going after you find Earth with the station you have.)  The story/lore (but short but also not really)  Turns out the current year is 3024 and Earth has been chaos for years. Pollution, global warming, poverty, war, and over-population. The poor stay poor while the rich get richer, as in the rich are very corrupt, nobody cares, people are dying and governments have no remorse, governments also only care about war now and none of the efforts to stop and of the issues on Earth. Some countries, including Sweden, Sudan, and Brazil have been torn apart and no longer exist due to the war, and governments have raided towns and killed million of innocents to "fix" over-population. It got really bad in 2097 and the lower class/lower-middle class on Earth started a revolution that began with a group of rebels in England. America and Canada decided they liked that idea and began revolting as well, led by Jason "Strider"   They were under-manned and didn't have enough power so lost all of their fights until military defectors smuggles weapons to them. War was tearing apart the world. It turns out in 2086 there was a dangerous disease called Plague 31-X was actually cured using a rare mineral found in deep space called Quettrenium (an ore you will find a lot in your journeys) cured the disease instantly. It also was used to make great machines and technology that could have been used to solve Earth's issues. But you know, corrupt government and war, also the fact that humans already mined up too much of it and can't find any in their general area of space. NASA and ECRO (Earth Crisis Response Organization) are the only two government funded organizations left that aren't used for making weapons, although NASA is on the brink of being wiped from the history books. They decide to secretly send a manned mission to deep deep deep space to find more and illegally make these machines. You were the Captain, and your crew ran out of fuel before you found anything. An anomaly  attack destroyed your station and gave you a mind-wiping concussion. Your crew (or a lot of it if your playing with others) died. At the end of the game, when you make it back to Earth, you land in the middle of a city surrounded by soldiers. But the soldiers have the rebels crest and you learn that the rebels won against the government, although Earth is still suffering. There are three different endings depending on a few things.  Bad ending: You make it back to Earth but you have 300 or less Quettrenium. Not enough to build any machines and every human on Earth dies out eventually due to all the bad stuff and an attack from the Queen.  Okay ending: You have 301-1.9k Quettrenium. Earth get's sustained for the next few couple hundred years but eventually Earth does fall to it's inevitable doom due to bad stuff and the queen.  Good ending: You have 2k- Quettrenium and you are able to rebuild NASA and ECRO from the ground up. The Queen attacks but Earth does defeat it, although due to the attack a lot of Europe has been destroyed. You build Quettrenium machines that sustain Earth.Secret ending: During you expedition kill the Queen in space. Have 10k or more Quettrenium and have collected an "Strange Orb" (a very rare item found in alien settlments). The Queen never attacks and the machines are built as well as NASA and ECRO are put back together. The orb is studied and actually creates a new livable planet that begins to orbit the sun. It forms unnaturally fast, within about 80 or so years, and it massively helps with the over-population issue.
 
Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein RPG 
I was thinking that it could be interesting to make an open-world RPG based on the book version of Frankenstein. It would be based in a gothic style world where you’d play as the Creature. The game would start off by allowing you (through Dr. Victor Frankenstein) to create the Creature. This could give an excuse for both the customizable appearance of the Creature as well as the distribution of stats (like Strength, Intelligence, etc). Once you were out in the world, you would most likely have the end goal of finding Dr. Frankenstein again and, in between, wander around through villages and perform side quests. Leveling up could be done with the idea that the Creature is upgrading itself and you could easily fit in alternate paths and choices for ways to complete the story, missions, and side quests.
 
Kung Fu game in Mexico where you play as a man with chi abilities trying to stop the Cartel in his town 
This game will have one of those old 80s kung fu movie feel to it. I would imagine the game to be like the arkham games combat wise except you have a chi system and level system. In the game you will have a chi bar which you can use go activate to use chi based attacks.Chi attacks deal alot of damage and is good for crowd control. Everytime you level up you can either increase your health, increase your chi meter, or gain new moves. There will be a variety of enemies who will test your skill for example there will be enemies who if they hit your pressure point you wont be able to use your chi attacks for a certain amount of time.
 
A JRPG in English that slowly turns the text to Japanese to help you learn. 
Just so that the language learned isn't all fantasy/anime trope stuff, the story should probably begin in the real world and introduce a conflict which brings in the capacity for sci-fi or fantasy terms as well.&#x200B;One of the core mechanics of the game would be that all kinds of items (nouns), quests (verbs), and statuses/spells (adjectives, adverbs) would, when successfully collected, completed, answered, etc. gain you progress in the story of bringing balance back into the world. Even mundane things like coffee pots or entrance exams need to be dealt with because all aspects of humanity are under attack. Anything could house a secret power or equipment status (or hide an enemy! Mimics everywhere!). Grammar is gained throughout the arcs when reflecting upon all your exploits . Etc. Etc.&#x200B;The point being that the more you can learn to interact with in the language, the better you can do. There would need to be some non-linear design just because players may learn words in different orders than others. When you opt into some content in the game like a quest, a certain batch of words will be turned to Japanese terms. Some of the most powerful tools to collect are the characters of the writing system, the kana and the kanji. You as the player don't have to do perfectly well, and actually, the game can be completed mostly in English if changing too much stuff to Japanese proves hard. But THEN, every time you select New Game +, your prior knowledge comes with you and you can see the earlier scenes in the game in more and more Japanese form.&#x200B;Spoken voices would likely be 100% Japanese, not because dubs are dumb and bad, but for constant help in listening skill. Subtitles, menus, text boxes would be the things that change over time, although a hard-core Japanese-only text and voice mode would always be available on demand.&#x200B;The problem is that changing words gradually hits a brick wall when grammar and phrasing is so, so different between the two languages. There is only so much that you can do substituting word for word. Like "I'm hungry" becomes literally "stomach emptied" in Japanese. So there would need to be honest to goodness full steps when changing the script at many points. That said, as long as the game was fundamentally interesting enough and mechanically fun to play with a deep battle system, interesting characters, and puzzles that got MORE interesting the more language knowledge you can put into them, hopefully players would be willing to play through the game repeatedly without dying of rerun boredom.&#x200B;I mean, I'd play it.
 
Hell Tycoon (Prison Architect, but in Hell) 
Due to overpopulation hell no longer has enough demons to handle all the newcomers, so the devil decides to hire new souls. You as a player get offered a job. Think prison architect but in hell.So you get to work. As in any other tycoon game you build and optimize, hire other demons as workers. Souls are the main currency, after serving their sentences souls go to heaven, and you get paid by the number of souls processed. Certain offenders like pedophiles never get to leave. But you do get various bonuses and boosts (Multipliers, Unique tech, etc) for torturing them endlessly. You start to lose money and risk getting fired if backlog gets too long or souls are not tortured enough. In addition to classical hell torture boiling pots etc, you being a human from 21st you can devise new ways, more efficient ways. (Think black mirror). The game will have a tech tree/lab (Special building) where you can unlock new more efficient ways. (Maybe even implement a system where user can come up with completely new unique devices etc).Prior to the start of the game, player can choose who he/she used to be before dying, this will give various bonuses. (Accountant: 10% more $ from processed souls, engineer more tech points, etc). Occasionally, by chance or by unlocking things you will get special souls, think of Hitler, torturing them will offer unique game abilities or bonuses.This can be a complete sandbox experience, or have proper progression/missions, perform good, get promoted to a higher status demon, etc. Eventually, replace the devil himself.I really don't want this to be mixed with religion, so will try to not make it appear as a pure Christian, Muslim, etc game, so the lore will be mixed. Not sure if just one disclaimer in the game will be enough, so any suggestions are welcome.Well, that is the premise, with time more things can be added. As imagination is running wild, but I need to keep it small, being a one-man team. I am seriously considering creating this game, so was interested in getting second opinions, would you play/buy this? \*PS, my Grammarly plugin is confused right now :)
 
Practicing some simple pixel art and animations... Do you think something could come out of this? 
 
You run a shop. It's your job to make weapons and armor which will keep heroes alive. 
A hero comes to your shop and tells you about his mission. You get clues about his temperament from his attitudes and mannerisms. You must build armor and weapons which will protect them where they are weak, and make them more deadly. Dumber and more suicidal heroes grant higher bonuses if they survive. It is your job to become the premier weapons and armor manufacturer for the realm.Heroes you save will bring you materials and artifacts for better weapons, and will sell their old weapons and other loot to you so that you can improve your offerings.
 
Sergeant Small and Corporal Tall 
2-player co-op 2-D platformer where one player controls a small soldier and the other one controls a tall soldier. The small soldier is limited in his jump height, hp, and reach, whereas the tall one is limited in crouch height, mobility, and is just overall a bigger target. The soldiers can perform special moves with each other to overcome obstacles (ex. throw the small soldier over a wall so he can infiltrate the base and open the door, use the big one as a human shield/ram, small one rides piggyback to defend the big one from aerial attacks, small one is used as a thrown weapon if equipped with a certain item).Enemies and levels should be designed to work with the two characters' strengths and weaknesses.
 
A shooter where you play both sides 
So I had this campaign idea where you play as two characters. The twist is, however, that the two characters are fighting on opposite sides of the war without the player knowing. The story makes it seem that both characters are on the same side, as they both recieve the same propaganda and reasons for fighting. The player doesn't  realize that the characters are on opposite sides until the very end where one character goes on a sniper mission and kills a target. After the target is shot, it switches to the other character on a walk in the woods, where suddenly his best friend is killed by sniper fire. The player is supposed to then realized that he was the one who fired the shot. The goal of the game is to show the real effects that war has, and that both sides can be convinced that their cause is right.
 
A side-scrolling bullet hell game in which you hijack enemy gunships. 
It's a side-scrolling bullet hell game except your character doesn't have his own gunship. Instead, he has to eject from whatever ship he's in and commandeer another enemy ship.Unlike traditional bullet hell games, all ships have their own individual health pools. If your current ship takes enough damage, you'll want to eject before it explodes. Taking lots of damage is a given, so you'll be hijacking often.When you eject, a tiny sprite of your character launches out and can dive or glide onto enemy ships. You're very vulnerable in this state, however. One shot like this and you're dead.Once you steal an enemy ship, the stolen ship turns around to face the right direction.Small enemy ships can be hijacked easily, but the bigger gunships need to be weakened before you can steal them. If you land on a boss ship, you might have to run on top of it while avoiding enemy fire, to reach the cockpit. Heck, you might even use that same enemy fire to weaken the hull so you can get in.Enemy missiles are particularly fun. You don't hijack them like enemy ships; rather, you *surf* on them to steer them into enemy ships. You'd have to jump off before impact, however.There would be one particular boss fight, ripped straight out of Contra 3, in which all you have to ride are enemy missiles. Without any ships to steal, all your pilot can do is jump from missile to missile, steering them all to the boss ship's weak points.
 
A game where you, a robot, rebuild yourself as you fight. 
Imagine a game where you could loot enemies for new parts, not for armour or weapon, but as a part of yourself.A battle-worn warrior on the verge of death, you were granted a second chance at life by an eccentric scientist. You agreed, and became a sentient android, your instinct the only human part left. With your prowess and his regenerative technology, you were near invincible; your parts could now repair themselves as long as they had the resources.My dream version of the game would be a 2D hack and slash roguelike. You aim with a mouse/analog stick, with two buttons for combat, each can be melee or ranged depending on which “limb” you have. As you strike or shoot enemies (who are robots) they blow up and parts go flying. If you hold a designated button near a part you would “pick it up”. Time slows down (think SuperHOT’s grabbing weapons in mid air) as you decide which slot to fit this new part into. Sword arm, gun arm, shield arm, laser arm, gun leg (?), wheel legs, missile shoulder pad, heat detecting visor. Maybe oddball combinations are allowed, like rocket launcher in the legs letting you fly.Careful not to lose your limbs. Losing an arm means fewer weapons. Losing legs equals loss of mobility: you can crawl with your hands or shoot, but not both. A headshot means you lose vision, too many shots: death. Keep extra limbs handy by plugging them into your back (I can imagine the main character looking like a porcupine, which could honestly be a cool design). If you end up Black Knight-ing with no limbs, you can roll around and absorb stuff from the ground.
 
A virtual pet game where you put other virtual pets into worker camps to harvest resources you need to pamper your favorite virtual pet 
So I'm thinking super cute and toony graphics with very dark humorGoal is to breed the best, most majestic, most adorable virtual pet. But to do this you need to build breeding and training facilities. You need toys and food and clothes and items of comfort. All this requires workers to build. And resources to harvest which requires more workers.How do you get workers? By enslaving your less than impressive virtual pets. Put them in the mines. Or send them to logger camps.Need clothes? Better get some sweatshops going. Don't forget you need test subjects for the performance enhancers and make up you're producing.Each of these jobs will allow the user to physically see their adorable and player bred virtual pets slaving away looking sad and tired and dirty.Genetics will also play a role in what your best virtual pets features will be. Through breeding you'll be able to perfect your chosen pet's color patterns, shapes, and abilities. You'll have to have patience and hand select suitors to get the perfect genes. Separate the winners at birth and send the rest to work. Or the incinerators if you don't need more labourersPlayers can compete globally in mini games that test your virtual pets abilities and beauty. There would be a photo mode too so you can share your perfect breed to the world.
 
A game set in Utah or that sort of area of America where you explore a large open map trying to find creatures from local Folklore and other mythical creatures from that area. 
 
Got a joke about a your country? 
Hello folks,Can I ask a favor?I'm from Denmark and have developed a drinking game in danish. It's satirical and politically incorrect- stuff the Danes love! The game is simple: There's a pile of cards with random commands or jokes, referencing danish history, events, and politics. Each player takes a turn to draw a card, read out its text and everyone around the table is reminded of this funny/cringy/awful thing, related to danish culture. It varies from current events to things from danish history.\[Here's a few examples:\]([https://i.imgur.com/l6sgRO0.png](https://i.imgur.com/l6sgRO0.png?fbclid=IwAR27fU8bI6wXpVC2b__vdKfCJul49_20pqBvXxz-LCZ3NlhAHIMKdupK1A4))I'm now working on an international version. I'm therefore seeking local/national jokes and references.Say your country has a sensitive subject or a certain tabu- Can you think of a joke or 'drinking game' that surrounds that subject? Any joke that fits your country, culture, and humor- whether it's political, soccer, tabu- whatever works Perhaps the card would only make sense in your country if you follow the news, or it might work globally.I hope you're interested in helping as I'd love to see this version come to life. Understanding every countries humor and differences is hard and takes a lifetime to learn- so any help is appreciated!Thank you for your time&#x200B;This is what I made out of your ideas. Thanks a lot :) [https://imgur.com/a/2ajakRe](https://imgur.com/a/2ajakRe)
 
A horror game that brings a soldiers PTSD to life 
I'm not good at story telling, but think it'd be a great concept and could simultaneously be educational and teach the player what PTSD can really feel like at an extreme.Ny idea would be to either play as the person coping with the PTSD, or maybe make that person a murderer and you're in the future. And you've moved into their home. Do a whole ghost / hunting situation, with even things like loud sudden explosions and gunfire, or whatever type of PTSD you go for if that is not the source, used to frighten the player.
 
Fetus Royale 
You are a fetus in the womb with a set of lots of twins. However only one of you gets to be born. Now you must kill your unborn twins. Idea from a conversation I had. https://m.imgur.com/a/jYRDzJzEdit: more fleshed outOk, expanded idea from continued conversation. It’s a weird 2d fighting game except instead of your favorite characters, it’s fetuses. The games will contain 2-8ish players. Each player controls a fetus. The idea is that there are too many twins for all of you to grow fully and be born safely, so you have to kill your twins before time runs out. Main ideas:1: Everyone is a fetus2: 2d fighting game in the style of smash bros3: Limited Time to kill opponents, or else everyone dies 4: one life onlyOther ideas:1: 3 stages of combat, based on each trimester, start out as a group of cells, and slowly grow bigger, adding your arms/legs/etc2: team mode with 2 player teams, each player controls half of a conjoined twin3: do enough environmental damage and you kill the mother and all die. 4:power ups based on absorbing dead twins?Edit2: spelling
 
Does someone know something I can put in a side scroller like The Messenger to make kids around 12 hyped for programming and highschool computer science? 
 
I'm a solo gamedev who SUCKS at art... 
So basically i suck at art. I'm 14 years old and finding someone my age who can do decent art is quite difficult, so seems like that's not an option. Whenever i try to do some pixel art i just end up making some kind of disturbing creature instead of a player... I'm okay with programming so that's not an issue i just need to know where to start so i could finally get some basic form of art in my games.**tl;dr i suck at art what would you recommend me to do(getting a teammate is probably not an option).**
 
I want to play a game where you are in the passenger seat of a car with new friends, and they demand you play the music for the entire trip. You have to keep them all happy with different genres while managing the mind numbing fear that comes with exposing your musical tastes to new friends. 
Bonus points for staying true to your actual musical tastes and not copping out by playing things you aren't that into.
 
A wish for a ghost sandbox simulator 
The general idea:A ghost sandbox simulator with good/neutral/evil/ mechanics.  A game where you play as the only ghost in town and roam around different locations trying to find a way to pass to the other side. You can play as a good ghost, bad or basically anything in between. Do you want to be like the Patrick Swayze ghost from the movie Ghost? Sure, you can do that. Maybe you want to be the Dude ghost and just do absolutely nothing valuable? Sure, no problem at all.  You could be doing everything from getting the neighbor dog to stop barking at 2 AM, take control over a person's body (think Beetlejuice) to swapping nametags at the local wedding party or just do absolutely nothing while you float over a family eating dinner in perfect harmony. You have to find out how you want to live your ghostly life and reap the consequences of your actions. Oh, and I forgot to mention, if people get too drunk, they might be able to engage in a spiritual conversation with you, making you able to plant ideas in their head, which could potentially have devastating effects.
 
Genre Flairs 
I think having genre flairs would be a good idea. Just the basic ones. (Puzzle, RTS, RPG, FPS, TPS, Other) People wouldn't have to scroll through different ideas for RTS, Puzzle, RPG etc when they want to find FPS ideas.I bet it would make scrolling through the sub easier imo
 
Suicide Watch - In an increasingly absurdly safe world, you must find a way to die. 
12th floor apartment building. A security guard patrols the room. Below, padded streets with padded cars driving on them. But what's that over there? It's your way out of this cruel cruel world, and you have to outsmart your overseers and overcome the increasingly safe standards of the area. The more damage you cause on the way out, the more coffin/gravestone swag you earn... or points.
 
A game about being a wartime reporter 
So basically, there's a conflict unfolding in some city. (I envisioned stuff like Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom when thinking about it), and you are a reporter. Essentially, the war will continue moving along at a fixed pace, in different areas around the city. You get a camera and a journal, and a free pass to most of the city (but not everywhere ;) ). You can run around the city and choose what to record and report. Maybe you could also attach to a platoon, following them around and documenting their actions. I feel that choosing what to record and show the outside world could make for some interesting scenarios, maybe a multiple ending type scenario.EDIT: Thank you guys all for your comments! Wasn't part of this subreddit before but I'm definitely sticking around now. Love the ideas you bring to the table.
 
Elevator Pitches: If you hook people on your game idea with your title you'll get a lot more interest in your full idea! 
[](/ksunsetinterested) So a lot of times I see posts here with vague or uninteresting titles, and I think that's an area people could work on. You could have the best game idea this sub has ever seen, but if you don't grab people's attention immediately it's just going to get scrolled by on people's reddit feed.You don't have to turn your title into a novel, but expanding just a bit on your idea will go a long ways towards getting you more traffic.---**Bad Example:** A Battle Royale game set in a desert.**Good Example:** A battle royale where players have to compete over an ever decreasing water supply to survive the harsh desert enviroment.---**Bad Example:** A puzzle game with crystals.**Good Example:** A puzzle game where you reflect light off of differently shaped crystal pieces to create shapes.---**Bad Example:** A trading card game with a twist.**Good Example:** A trading card game where players share a deck and compete to see who has the most cards by the end of the game.
 
A game where you can go back time but with a twist 
Inspired by webcomic, this game is a sort of action game where you can go back to a certain time to fix your mistakes or get the best outcome. But as you go back time more, the NPCs will also start to realize something is off and react differently (for example if you shot someone and repeated that multiple times because you went back time, they might take cover before you get a chance to take a shot). I still don't really know what this can fit well with but thought it would be a cool game mechanic that is not too overpowered
 
Social Deception Oregon Trail 
An idea I heard from a podcast I listen to but tried to flesh out a bit more. A social deception type game (Among Us, Project Winter) mixed with Oregon Trail. So, group of pioneers, one or two (depending on party size) are the "imposters" tasked with sabotaging the trip, rest are of course trying to make it to Oregon. Game flow goes as such:1. Each day shows an overview of the caravan going from place to place (just like the original, or Banner Saga like) with random events interlaced. The random events and hardships can be influence based on "impostors" actions in the towns and locations. Which leads to next part:2. Each location the caravan enters starts a section where the posse looks to buy supplies for themselves or improve their caravan with more oxen or wheels, etc. The impostors on the other hand are trying to sabotage either the wagon itself, the posse (through sickness maybe, or through turning the location ships against the posse), or the oxen.3. The final part of the game flow is the campfire. At the end of each day on the trail, the posse gathers around the camp fire for some discussion. This is akin to the emergency meetings in Among Us. Here, pioneers can be voted out of the posse, or not, depending on the discussions.Other than that, to win, get to Oregon for the pioneers, sabotage trip for the "impostors"As far as graphics go, I feel like the graphics in Project Winter would be absolutely perfect for this. Same camera as well. But honestly even 2D like Among Us would work.I have very little game dev experience but I have years of programming experience so I technically could probably work on this if I really tried but, full time job and such takes up time. If anyone wants to take a stab at this for realsies I would definitely be willing to learn/help out along the way because I feel like it could be a good game. Just an idea! Definitely looking for more ideas and feedback as well.
 
A 2D Platformer That Makes Fun of Tropes 
I'm planning on making an 8-bit game that makes fun of all kinds of tropes in games. It will have 3 simple levels and I am planning on finishing it before August with the game having 3 short levels and mini-bosses. An example of the game making fun of a trope includes the character falling into a pit and then respawning only to say "Huh, I respawned..... guess I'm in a video game" or for the character to buy an important component to upgrade their weapon only for a message to pop up saying "You attempted to upgrade your weapon although you have no experience in weapon making and so the upgrade is useless."  Stuff that's in all kinds of video game genres which don't make sense. Any ideas for jokes or criticism would be much appreciated.
 
A game where, to simulate pain, the framerate gets lower the more damage you take. 
Bonus: lower graphical settings offset this, but make important information harder to see.
 
A group of ~20 people are sent to a randomly generated boss fight 
Imagine a Battle Royale, but in reverse. Cool? Cool.You and your team need to kill the boss within a ten minute time limit. There’s a variety of weapons, including swords, bows, guns, etc. However, the challenge comes from the fact that nearly everything is determined randomly, including...-Which boss is fought-Player spawn location-Terrain (though nothing too crazy)-Location/Textures-Weapon Placement-Any intractable objects, i.e. trees, rocks, etc.On top of this, the boss is always fought on an island surrounded by water. It’s gradually sinking, thus explaining the need for a time limit. (Despite terrain & textures, the island is always the same size)Finally, an experience system is needed to reward players and keep them coming back. Every boss would have a set amount of EXP, and it’s multiplied by the amount of remaining players over 2, then multiplied by the amount of minutes remaining plus the number of seconds. I believe it would look like this...**(((Boss EXP)(#number of players alive/2)Minutes) + (Seconds)**So if a boss has 1,000 EXP, and there are 7 players left, with 2:15 left on the timer, each player would earn, rounded, 7,015 EXP. There would also be little EXP packets scattered around the map, or awarded to players for attacking bosses fast and consistently without taking damage.I thought briefly about a mechanic where higher leveled players can give some of their awarded EXP to lower leveled players, but I fear for the arguments that may cause.Anywho, if you have any suggestions, I’d like to hear them down below.
 
Just a game idea about not seeing anything, don't mind me 
When I have too much free time I like to think about game ideas (I want to become a game dev), but I never know if they're good ideas, so lemme know what you think about it :D&#x200B;The idea is quite simple. You are in a room with walls and pits, and you need to go to the exit. But of course there is enemies trying to kill you. You can't kill them so if you can avoid them, it's better. Also the game is turn-based.But what if you can't see the walls? How do I know where to go? Well that's quite simple. Let me explainThe player can do one out of 4 actions: Move, Teleport, Interact and Echo. The "Echo" ability is the reason this game exists in the first place. When you use this ability, every wall near the player character becomes surrounded by an "aura", making them visible to the player for 1 turn. But don't use it too much, because the enemies are attracted to Echo and will start going on that spot and potentially chase and/or even kill you, unless you use the Teleport ability, which resets the level, except you can't use this ability until you complete the level or die because it would be too easy to not die.&#x200B;(I apologize for potential mistakes since English isn't my primary language)
 
An RPG/TCG...for those who dislike either 
I've just rewatched a few old Extra Credits episodes (namely [No Gender Specific Mechanics](https://youtu.be/ERR1F-zoTVg) and [Non-Combat Gaming](https://youtu.be/2QJVGtKPjNc)) and they got me thinking. TCG-s and RPGs are generally two of the most hardcore oriented games. I actually have a group of friends, who really liked the idea of playing DnD together, but with the high learning cuve, none of them managed to get a good grasp on the game, and the whole idea just died out after a few week. They are, what you would call "casual players". One of them actually wanted to give magic a try, but again, didn't got comfotable enaugh with the rules to actually play with anyone other than me.And then I got the idea. I said "how about an RPG/TCG for casual players"? Not an RPG/TCG with easier rules, or a more noob-friendly enviroment. No. One, that is easily playable by anyone, who never heard of an RPG or TCG before!Introducing "Bard". A multiplayer game with endless possibilities. The core gameplay is similar to a TTRP, like DnD. Each player has a character with certain abilities and objectives to complete. An objective can be created by any player (so nobody has to be the "forever DM of the group") and also very noob-friendly. You basicly have a bunch of building block of setting, places, details, which you can use to build a scenario or objective, much like you build a house in The Sims. The objectives can be anything from a philosophical debate in a cofee shop to an artistic competition and even some combat based one, like a traditional RPG adventure. But in general, the scenarios would be more varied in terms of themes.As for the actual objectives and gameplay, the players could use a bunch of cards to complete the objectives. Cards would work like in traditional card game, like Bang! or Uno, or anything like that. The main mechanic would be a rock-paper-scissors realtion of different card instead of numbers, stats, or dice rolling, and the whole point would be to predict the opponents plays. Players can also make "carriers" trough multiplie scenarios and games to get more cards, upgrade their deck and get new combinations (basicly to ensure a good learning curve, players would have time to get familiar with all the cards.)These are just some basic thought on this game. What do you think about it? I've actually started to make it. I plan to make a board game out of it, mostly because of my 0 knowledge about coding, but if it turns out to be successfull, I want to find some help and make this into a legit browser game with JavaScript.
 
Game where you need to buy microtransactions 
&#x200B;The game is split into 2 parts:1. Gameworld2. Real lifeIn the gameworld you play to earn prizes like food, water, medicine, ect. If you get stuck, you can use in game money to buy items or advancements. The game changes through every day, like Day 1 it could be a shooter and Day 2 it's a platformer.In the real world you work a job to earn money to spend on the game and give necessities to family members and pay bills.EDIT: Using in-game money to buy in-game microtransactions.EDIT 2: The game would be intended to have a 13+ audience. There would also be voicelines of your character getting angry when you mess up in the game. The end goal is to survive for a month, which unlocks hard mode, harder games but better rewards.
 
A game where it's post apocalypse and religions form around pop culture. 
A massive event has happened, humans have forgotten religions such as Christianity and Islam, instead everyone found relics of old pop culture and formed religions around that. There are religions built around stuff as silly as Care Bears and My Little Pony. Except the names are changed for copyright reasons. All these different religions based on old pop culture and cartoons think their religion is the correct religion. Your goal is to pick a group and do battle with the others. Spread your religion and make new converts.
 
An RPG where you control the soundtrack 
This idea is pretty straightforward. You play an RPG character who, like Dragon Age's Grey Warden and Inquisitor, KOTOR II's Exile, and Skyrim's Dragonborn, has a unique ability: they can sense the ambient background music of the world and manipulate it. Abilities could range from intimidating shopkeepers by triggering combat music to buffing allies with the appropriate hero track.The player would assemble a team of possible allies, each based on the personality of a musical instrument. The closer the player gets to these allies the more their songs will harmonize, unlocking group maneuvers and dialogue options. The many cities of the game would be themed towards different music genres, causing allies to act differently to NPCs and each other. Perhaps the drum-based barbarian can fit it almost anywhere except the Victorian high life and the high brow violinist finds a home in the boonies. And of course these characters would talk like Charlie Brown's teacher using their respective instrument.The villains would be Noise and Silence, representing chaos and death, respectively. That's all I've got. This idea just seems like the perfect progression to the continued use of audio clues to guide players in video games.
 
Idea for a beginner game developer 
Hello guys!! I'm a beginner game developer and and now I'm stuck for practicing, please give me some good ideas for starting with the practice, I don't know why but this is getting hard for me to get an idea for development.It's been a week, but i could found a simple idea. Guys please help.
 
Gameidea might be a dead end 
I started prototyping a little game (my first game) and don't know how to improve it to make it actually fun.Here is the basic idea I implemented so far: There are two players, a farmer who herds cows along a map into a barn and a UFO that tries to abduct the cows. The farmer  basically has to walk behind the cows which will always walk away from him and if he walks too fast they will spread out and he has to lead them together to a bunch.The UFO is basically hovering and can abduct the cows with its beam.I already implemented a level and the basic mechanics, there is only one problem: The game itself is quite boring. It is a bit cumbersome for the farmer to keep the cows together and lead them on the way and it is pretty easy for the UFO to abduct the cows. In some test runs, the UFO almost always wins, cause it is too easy for it (or too hard for the farmer, depending on the viewpoint)Does anyone have an idea how to make this game fun? I'm almost about to throw this idea away because I can't figure out how to make it fun.EDIT: Wow guys thank you so much for all the awesome ideas! I wasn't aware of how much potential this idea had! What an awesome community this subreddit is
 
Subreddit idea: Google your idea before posting it here, because i swear 80% of ideas posted here are games that already exist 
It's fine if you have a new twist for an existing idea, or you think about a way to make it better, but in that case please reference the original games to show you did some research and know what you're talking about.
 
Roguelike: Whenever you defeat a boss and then die, you start your next run as that boss 
You start the game with your main character. After you defeat a boss and then die, you play as the boss you've defeated on your next run. Either your main character could replace the boss you've defeated, or to make things more spicy, your starter character could be the final boss.
 
Gordon Ramsay VR cooking sim where he berates you 
I’m talking Hell’s Kitchen style rather than kitchen nightmares, etc.Multiplayer where you and your friends are line cooks and have to serve a night whilst Gordon Ramsey gets in your face and has different reactions depending on your success or failure.I hope I’m not alone on this
 
Massively cooperative zombie survival game 
So, this is mainly inspired from [Die2Nite](http://www.die2nite.com/?lang=en#index) game (or "Hordes" in french). But instead of being a rather slow browser game, it would be more fast paced and played as a standalone game.* In this game, you would join a server with 20-30 people, and you have to collectively survive as long as you can (perhaps until help comes, or you invent a way to get out). You start in the middle of "the city", a makeshift town you need to fix and upgrade.* There are zombies out there, they attack when you come close, but they only get really dangerous at night : they try to raid the city. You have little to no weapons, you have to rely on the makeshift traps and walls you built during the day.* During the day, you need to fix the city up and look for resources outside, however you have to take care as everything you do consumes your stamina. That includes crafting, building, walking, fighting, researching...  You can only recover stamina by sleeping in town, eating or drinking (which consumes precious resources).* The biggest challenge is for all the people to organise themselves, decide what to build first, on what to spend ressources, and who does what. In game chat (or vocal chat) needs special attention to make the concept work.* Players could elect a mayor, which would be able to act like a "moderator" and "commander", being able to banish, emprison or execute people for example.* Ressources outside are sometimes in places that are far away, or are behind obstacles that need to be worked on. Carrying stuff back to the town in itself needs organisation as people have limited inventory.* Players can gain afflictions, for example ; bitten by zombie, addicted to drug-like powerups... which require the whole village to be attentive as some players could be given selfish objectives by the game.* Biggest issue to tackle would be the game's pace. If the game is too fast organisation will not be possible, if it is too slow people will leave the server before the game ends, which kind of defeats the whole idea.Hope you like it, feel free to use.
 
Survival horror game with no jump scare and with learning experience. Based on Paranoia 
A game based to common phobias.**Story**After an terrifying accident, the protagonist went into coma. In order to recover, the player need to go through 10 of his/her scariest phobias. After completing the 10 phobia, the last stage will be a combination of all ending with FOMO or isolophobia as the player will see his family leaving him behind and it will be a players decision to chase them back (to gain back consciousness) or not (remain in coma).**Phobia** includes1. Agoraphobia: fear of open spaces2. Astraphobia: fear of storms.3. Acrophobia: fear of heights with  Pteromerhanophobia: fear of flying.4. Claustrophobia: fear of enclosed spaces.5. Mysophobia: the excessive fear of germs and dirt6. Trypanophobia: fear of needles7. Ophidiophobia: fear of snakes8. Cynophobia: fear of dogs.9. Entomophobia: fear of insects.10. social phobia: fear of being in social eventThese are the order that I have decided and I will describe them in more detail in Game-play**Graphics**It will be in a first person like most horror simulator. It does not need to be realistic, but it would be better**Game-play**1. for Agoraphobia, you have to row your boat in a dark open sea. Find out the cardinal directions after identifying the astrological signs in the sky using a astrological signs picture. 2. Astraphobia depicts by dark thunderous cloud covering the stars and the sky. You can to move away from the strike by timing the difference when the thunder sounds and the lighting flashes.3. After moving away from the storm, you will free fall into waterfall without the boat. It will be like Falling Fred where you have dodge twigs, furniture, pets, rocks, boulders and more.4. You will then fall into a room that changes (like in layers of fear) where you solve hardcore puzzles.  More mistakes you made the smaller it gets. For Claustrophobia. 5. Mysophobia can be shown by dirt falling into the room and the walls where you have to dodge and clean them6. Trypanophobia: avoid spikes that pop up of the floors, roof and walls. Gather sponges to put on spikes. 7. Ophidiophia: a door leads to a room with snakes. Gather sticks, fiberglass, fuel, matches and more to make a torch. Stomp the ground when the snakes gets closer. Cool down by any means as snake detects heat.8. Cynophobia: you have exited the room but there are dogs. Bait the dog, move around them slowly to avoid detection. The dogs will have like a flash light on their head so you know which way they are looking.9. Entomophia: Now there is light, you enter the forest.

Puzzle game where you switch to a different dimension everytime you die 
The one game I always wanted to make was one that obeys the laws of parallel universes. Whenever you die, instead of respawning, you switch over to the closest equivalent of your character in another dimension. The more you die the more things escalate and get crazier. I want the beginning to be very subtle, so it fucks with your mind until you figure out the mechanic. First couple dozen deaths you don’t really notice anything, just a pot moved slightly over, stuff like that, but with enough deaths and incompetence you may even end up on a different planet. This would be a puzzle game with a linear story, a fixed progression of goals, and some basic combat mechanics similar to Heat Signature.&#x200B;For anyone interested who wants more precise details, here are the most coherent notes I found from years ago:\>You start in an office as a boring nobody, maybe first death you get clobbered by a door, second you avoid that cleverly but slip on the floor. Eventually you’re in a helicopter circling the building, then the office was never built and it’s just a field, then, like, a volcano, a barren planet, one populated by aliens, on some spaceship, stranded in deep space, whatever.\>Maybe you eventually switch to a dimension in which your character is a night guard. Then a police officer. Then a soldier. That would be a nice smooth transition from trivial deaths to combat.\>12 deaths per world, with 3 transitional worlds each, meaning 48 deaths before you switch to another major world. I’d like, say, 1000 deaths (so \~20 worlds ) before you start looping through them, and even then the character will be like ‘hmm, not quite as I remember though’ because of procedually generated minor details. The closer you get to the next world, the higher the weight of that world’s details are to appear. First set is in a fixed order, but when it starts looping I’d quite like the order to get randomized. That would mean the transitional worlds either get picked from both, so minimal additional work would be required, or we have a whole new set of transitionals for each possible pair, which would make this a developmental hell and even as a top-down arcadey game it’d probably need a AAA budget.
 
White Pants 
A racing game where you unlock white pants for your driver which you never see. 
 
A 2D-platformer where you have to give your playable character the illusion of freewill 
The challenge is to put your eyes in the eyes of your playable character.  If you ever do anything completely unreasonable to the perspective of your character, your character will have an existential crisis and die.Anything outside of the playable character's field of view should logically be off-limits.  If there's an arrow showing you where to go but the character can't see it, don't follow it.  That should be easy enough, but this mechanic also makes even something as simple as jumping off a ledge to get to a platform underneath where you were standing illogical in the eyes of the character, as the character didn't know the platform was there.  You also have to turn around to see that enemy walking behind you *before* you jump over it.  You have to make your character think he/she has freewill.Also, dying and respawning would logically get rid of any of the character's recent memories, so, if you ever find out a passcode then die, for instance, it wouldn't make since to be able to input that passcode immediately without discovering it again.*How it Might Work*Every notable thing your character "sees" should probably be represented on a HUD somewhere, which, of course, empties if you die.If a HUD would be too hard to keep track of, then maybe the better solution would be to have objects you've seen flashing/glowing.If any visual indication would be too blunt, then maybe there could be no visual indication and instead you have a "suspicion tolerance" meter that acts as a secondary health bar which drains whenever you do something suspicious in the eyes of the character.*Difficulty*It *sounds* like intermediate difficulty to program, but I have absolutely nothing to judge that off of so maybe not.It could be a fun short little game.
 
Satirical "inverse stealth" game where there's no consequences to something if you can't see it. 
I thought of this more as a joke than anything else, but I get the feeling it could still be made into an actual game. It's like a stealth game where you're trying to hide things from yourself, but it'd probably be more like a puzzle game. You're tasked with various tasks that should land you in trouble, but you never experience any consequences to anything as long as you can "plausibly" deny knowing about it. Even guards can't do anything to you if you don't notice that they've noticed you.I'm imagining that levels would have sets of conditions for deniability that would get stricter as the difficulty ramps up, but never stops being ridiculous. A goal of dumping toxic waste in a lake with a condition like "not looking" would require you to simply not be looking the second the waste hits the ocean. A goal of stealing a bag of money with the condition "unknown object" would require you to swap a bag with a dollar sign on it with a different container, before the dollar sign bag gets filled up. And a goal of killing someone with conditions like "Never seen, minimum distance 20" would require you to not once see your target and to be 20 steps away once your target dies.I hope I wrote this well, and that at least someone is at least amused with this concept.
 
(Trapper idea) 
Ok this is just a rough idea, So Im willing to hear your guys feedback. so your a cowboy that has to hunt Cyptids across a wild west setting,So it would be like Mega man/ Shovel knight a with a 32 bit styleHere are the 15 bosses: TX Chupacabra, WI Wendigo, AK Tizheruk, CA Dark watchers, WV Mothman, KS Sinkhole Sam, ME Specter Moose, MS Pascagoula river aliens, NJ Jersey Devil, NM Teratorn, SC Lizard men, WY Jackalope, OH Lovland frogmen, CO Slide rock bolter, And finally WA BigfootThe weapons I've thought of are double barrel shotgun, a sixshooter, and a bear trap that pull's monsters to you and can be used as a grappling hook.That's all thank you for reading!
 
i found this idea. 
 
Photobomb the World - A VR game in which you photobomb NPCs who just wanted to capture a nice memory. 
Due to one of the dumbest wishes a genie has ever heard, you are now constantly teleported to anywhere someone is about to take a picture so you can photobomb them. When you arrive to whichever absurd random location the picture is taking place, you have only a few seconds to grab whatever props you want from the scene to pose before the picture is taken. You can interact with nearly everything and anything in the scene to get just the right photobomb.A wedding picture at a beach in Bali? A selfie at a rock concert? A crime scene capturing evidence? The last picture by a rover on Mars? Yes, all that! I made myself sad though.Pictures are scored by composition, prop use and other obscure factors. You can also share your pictures for others to rank. But more importantly, people can insert themselves into your pictures to photobomb your photobomb. The seconds setting up for the photobomb are all captured for playback for anyone that wants to upload themselves into your photobomb scene.
 
An RTS where you fire everything out of a Cannon 
You start with a single base and a big Cannon.  When you want to place a new building, you go into a first-person view to aim your cannon and fire.  Wherever the building lands, it is built.  The same with deploying units.You can zoom out to a top down map to get an overview, but most of the game is spent building/researching new units and shooting your cannon.  The unit AI would be simplistic, you couldn't give direct orders.  Once a unit lands somewhere, it will start a predictable behavior (advancing towards the nearest enemy, harvesting resources, etc).You can build an expensive new base (including a new cannon) and shoot it somewhere.  Then you can start deploying from *that* cannon as well, spreading yourself across the map.Your gathered resources would also be the cannon's propellant.  If you want to launch further, it costs more resources (and has more chance of inaccuracy).The most valuable resource fields would be surrounded by acid pits, making them risky to shoot for.  There would be wind effects, or powers triggered by other players to interfere with your aiming (like a smoke screen that obscures your view of part of the map).This could also have a medieval theme using Catapults and Trebuchets.EDIT:  The map would kind of be inspired by golf courses.  There'd be mountains and acid lakes that you could attempt to shoot over, but it would be risky.  Or you could play it safe and work your way around the map gradually.EDIT: The aiming would be very manual, no UI indicators of where things will land.  There would be light,medium, and heavy payloads you could fire, and you'd have to adjust for weight as well as amount of propellant used.  
 
We need more grand strategy games that focus on intelligence and not on warfare. 
So there is only 1 game I know of that focuses on the intelligence side of conflicts and not on the tanks and planes side. It's called Precipice and it's cute, it has enough content for maybe 4 rounds, total. So to to into a bit more detail. I want a grand strategy game that instead of being like HoI4 which basically only focuses on warfare, or vic2 that almost exclusively focuses on economy and trade. Focuses on building a national intelligence network (like CIA or Mossad), conducting covert operations abroad in domestically, destabilizing governments, managing agents, sabotage and maybe even using data you collect to successfully wage wars (making it so that if you don't have informants in the right places, enough satellites or planes your army wouldn't be able to see more then 10 kilometers in front of them putting them in a huge disadvantage, or if you manage it successfully putting you in a huge advantage.), Counter - espionage, ect... It naturally also needs to have management elements to it.
 
A casual game idea about monster transformation. 
Hi guys. I'm just thinking about a casual online game, which could be on Mobile or Web - based. Unfortunately I don't know anything about graphics and game design, so it's just an idea. I did try to implement it on Java, but it looks weird without the graphics. (*Insert sad face*).So, please let me know what you guys think.#CONCEPT:This *casual* game sets up in a map (a city, a festival,...), with 4 - 7 players each game. One or two of them (depends on the number of players) will be chosen randomly to be the **Guardians**. The rest will be the **Mutated**.The **Mutated** win if they can defeat all the Guardians in a set period of time. Whoever deals the most damage to the Guardians is the MVP, and take the highest rewards. In contrast, the **Guardians** wins at least 1 of them still survive after the time runs out.#IN - DEPTH:- The map is filled with numerous bots (can be human, animals..., depends on the theme) that wanders around. At first, both the **Mutated** and the **Guardians** camouflage as one of these bots, sharing the same appearance as one of them, and freely roams through the map in this appearance.- The **Mutated** can consume the bots to charge up their *Energy Gauge*. However, if they mistakenly try to consume the **Guardians**, they will be killed instantly. They respawn later, but 50% of their **Energy Gauge** will be depleted.- When their *Energy Gauge* is full, they can reveal themselves and transform  into a monster of their choice (welp, with gigantic appearance). Each monster have a different set of abilities.- For the **Guardians**, after a certain of time passes (may be 2 mins, 3 mins,...), or when at least 1 **Mutated** has transformed; they also unlock the ability to transform into the **Guardians** of their choice. They also have their own set of skills.- If a transformed monster or guardian is defeated, it will not respawn. Transformed guardian can still hit non - transformed **Mutated**, but will not deplete their *Energy Gauge* anymore.- **Guardian**'s strength is based on the number of **Mutated** players.- When not transformed, the **Guardians** have 1 special ability (of their choice) to help them with the process.---------------------------**Thank you very much for reading my post ! Please let me know what you think.**
 
A mix between Eurotruck Simulator and Mad Max. 
A vehicular Combat game, with Physics sophisticated enough to work with Wheel, but still simplifyed. (think ETS2, SpinTires).You play a big rig and it's your Job to deliver goods through the wasteland. Depending on the delivery you got Friends/enemies, but there are also sections where it's serene and the Environment is your only foe.Weapons are quite realistic and People try to bring you down with MGs, RammingDevices, etc.. I would make Ammo limited so it's more like WW2 planes aiming at the bomber and then leaving.The Satisfaction Comes from surviving and a DamageModel like in Wreckfest (semi-realistic) where a lot of stuff happens naturally and non-scripted.The final ingredient is Customization of your Rig, plating it yourself and hoping it survives.&#x200B;PS: Or Maybe as a multiplayer title ala Black Sails where your Friends board and protect other rigs,&#x200B;&#x200B;It's just a silly idea I had on a roadtrip where I whished for a kinda realistic game that involves convoys and ramming as core ingredients and that isnt over the top. Also a lot of games Forget to include the Environment in a meaningfulway. Roadtrips in real life are fun because of all the crazy roads that await you and that's why ETS2 is selling like crazy.Also as good as ETS2 is selling that might actually work if ist done wll.
 
A game that is a virtual Catholic confessional booth 
You are given tasks and boss fights as penance depending on the sins you confess, but they occur in a cycle like the Rosary, and also involve completing so many Hail Marys and Our Fathers while fighting off minions.The best part: indulgences are available as in-app purchases.
 
Made concept art for a game. The idea is about a vaguely cannibalistic fish samurai in feudal japan 
 
How to choose which game idea to go with? 
Hi all,We're developing this free Steam data platform called [Video Game Insights](https://vginsights.com/) and I recently wrote an article on **how to use data to help choose between different game ideas**.I now accidentally stumbled on this sub-reddit and thought this might be really relevant here![https://vginsights.com/insights/article/how-to-choose-which-game-to-develop-a-step-by-step-guide](https://vginsights.com/insights/article/how-to-choose-which-game-to-develop-a-step-by-step-guide)The principle of using data to make your choice isn't that you should disregard what you want to make. It's more that it's helping you to make a choice when and if you're torn between several good ideas.Ultimately, the decision should come down to supply and demand of the idea you're planning to make. There's little chance that another standard 2D platformer will be massively popular, for example.I appreciate this is not a concrete idea, but feels super relevant to the community of this subreddit. We're literally doing it as a hobby to help indie devs. :)

How about a fantasy dungeon crawler, but without swords? 
I'm pretty new here, so I'll just give a simple idea for someone to work with.&#x200B;The idea is that, at the beginning of the game, you can choose a weapon out of many different ones to go through the same dungeon with. The catch is, no swords, as swords tend to be the most overused weapons in fantasy and the most all around, and the challenge here is to have your players try to figure out the optimal play for a new weapon. The other challenge would be figuring out how to differentiate the weapons you have gameplay wise from swords or the other weapons. &#x200B;The weapons I was thinking about were:Dagger: Very short ranged, doesn't do much damage, but is quite fast. It could be replaced with gauntlets for similar effect, and does less damage to armored enemies. Does Piercing damage.Axe: The slowest and most lumbering weapon, with very wide swings and a lot of lag, but does a lot of damage and hits armor hard. Worse vs single targets but is decent crowd control. Does Piercing and blunt damage.Spear: Decent speed and the longest, non projectile range. Good at keeping monsters off you, as it has pretty good knockback, but once the mob is on you, its hard to get them off. Not a crazy amount of damage either. Does Piercing DamageBoat Oar: A bit more unconventional weapon, but it has decent range and decent hitstun, but doesn't do much damage. Does Blunt damage and is probably the best crowd control option out of these.Mace: Hits very hard and does very well against armored opponents, but is short ranged and rather slow, and is very poor at crowd control. Does blunt damage.Handgonne: A very early gun, it hits hard and is ranged, but takes time to reload. Does piercing damage and hits all foes in a straight line, but is still difficult to crowd control. You can hit stuff melee with it like a stick, but its by far the weakest out of these without shooting.&#x200B;Theres a lot of other weapons you could choosing, I just thought these 6 were interesting and could lead to some well rounded gameplay. There are still other possible weapons, like hammers, whips, polearms, pikes, Picks, Shovels, War Clubs, Bows, javelins, and shields that can be tried out. Heres a good list for them:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_premodern\_combat\_weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_premodern_combat_weapons)
 
Hacker FPS 
Aimbot, noclip, ESP, flying all of these are mechanics/skills in this FPS, aimbot is always on, flying can be turned on and off, but noclip and ESP are skills that can be activated for a certain amount of time.The thematic would probably be cyberpunk or magicpunk.
 
You play as a huge robot in space that goes out and puts deodorant on planets 
Planets call you up and asked to be sprayed with certain types of deodorant for the upcoming Planetary Ball, which takes place at the centre of the Andromeda Galaxy. The ball is in three weeks so you have to get around quickly. The puzzles would come from: having to make the right mixture of deodorant; putting on the right amount; finding fuel and fixing your thrusters; and navigating  space-related obstacles, like giant umbrellas; big, blue pelicans; and asteroid fields. 
 
An unrealistic game in need of a stupid story. 
Hi there, I'm working on a game inspired by Baldi's Basics.I'm searching for a fitting story about the game. The name of the game is Boneless Bobby, it's also the name of the main enemy.I really like the name, but I haven't figured out who the enemy is exactly is.The looks of the game is very 'meme' and the art style is sort of 'bad' on purpose.The whole game isn't meant to be taken seriously and is very random.&#x200B;Here are some WIP screenshots of my game: [https://imgur.com/a/LQGp1fY](https://imgur.com/a/LQGp1fY)This is a mix of some rooms, halls and AI's that I'm showing, there's a big chance that the final product will differ a lot!First let me tell you what the game is about.&#x200B;The player starts in a building.The building is randomly generated and consists of large halls leading to different rooms.Each room contains a simple object that represents a puzzle, when the player clicks on this object a 2D puzzle appears. The player has to complete the puzzle in order to get an object\*.After completing a x\*\* amount of puzzles, the player is able to leave the building and finish the game.&#x200B;However there are multiple AI's making it hard for you to escape the building.There's the main enemy, whenever he touches you, you are 'death' and the game restarts. And there's multiple other AI's, they can't 'kill' you, but will obstruct you in getting to the rooms.For example one AI is able to freeze you for a few seconds if he is close,this makes it so the main enemy/AI is able to get to you and then you're done.The main enemy wanders everywhere and the other AI's only wander through the hallways.The map will contain different elements besides AI that can help or obstruct the player to get to his location.&#x200B;As you know that the game isn't trying to be realistic and logical but rather funny and stupid,I'm looking for a fitting suggetsions to make the story.&#x200B;\- What exactly is the building the player is in? (Is it a fantasy house? Is it a meme prison?)\- Why is the player in this building? (Was he captured because his memes were to bad? Is he dreaming? Perhaps he was summoned there because he ate all the boneless pizza wings?)\- Who is the main enemy aka Boneless Bobby? (Why is he boneless? Where could his name come from?)\- What kind of objects has the player to collect in order to leave the building? (Does he have to collect skulls, apples, photo's of Karens?)\- If the player got all the objects, what should he do with the objects? (Does he have to deliver them to a certain person in a room who gives him the key to escape or do something else?Do all the objects together form a code that he needs to fill in to escape?)&#x200B;\* I haven't determined what the object will be that the player has to collect.\*\* It isn't determined how much puzzles the player has to solve.&#x200B;I had a basic story before I started developing this game, but I didn't like my own story. That's why I'm asking you guys to fill in the open gaps I'm stuck with now.I'm curious on what you guys can come up with!
 
Home Alone multiplayer game? 
The plot of Home Alone is usually, for most of the movies, to prevent the thieves from entering the house, and if so, trapping them or injuring them, until you manage to escape and contact the authorities.My idea doesnt necessarily have to go along with the movies, but i just thought it fit with the idea.Could be a group of 1-4 kids who are home alone while parents are away, and figure out someone or a few people have broken in. You’d set child-like traps (christmas decorations to slip or cut feet, slippery ice, paint cans on the stairwell, ext. to prevent advancement while you hunt down the phone somewhere in the house.Not sure quite yet what would happen to captured kids, aside from the others being able to rescue them somehow while the criminals are distracted. I dont expect the setting to be the same and get repetitive, but maybe the home can cycle through 5-6 houses, or a procedurally different home each time, so traps and routes arent so expected.The goal for the criminal would be to catch the kids and make off with something or a variety of valuable objects around the home before they can be caught.The goal of the kids of course is to stop the criminal and contact either their parents or the police, and knock out the criminals so they can be arrested.Not my grandest idea, but it felt like something that could be something fun to try on multiplayer, like a kids version of Dead by Daylight with a holiday or halloween theme.
 
a game where you are the final boss 
the name says it all, you are the final boss of the game you are playing and there would be a few levels of varying difficulty like for example: easiest difficulty would be a person who finished the game letting their friend who never played it play, and the hardest difficulty would be a world record holding speedrunner who knows all the tricks to defeat you
 
VR vs. PC players raid style battles with match making 
The person in VR would be a giant boss type enemy while a group of 10 players on a normal PC setup would work together to take them down. Think MMO style raid battles but with match making.This would be awesome because only one person in a group of friends would need to have VR for them all to play the game, and it would help get more people who don't have a VR setup interacting with the VR space and seeing the tech in action. It would also solve the issue of VR online match making taking forever because there are few people with VR.
 
A Neural Network is learning your fighting style while you play 
Two mechanical ideas, both weird and abstract, both similar, I don't know which is better.1: a game with a wicked long campaign. 30+ hours, probably. In that time, a neural network in the game's code is learning your fighting style. The final boss is a copy of your character (clone, evil twin, whatever, the story can figure out something thematically interesting) that fights with your fighting style, since a neural network has had 30 hours to train.2: Same idea, but the game has two endings at the final boss:--1: you lose, and this is the expected ending.--2: you win, and your fighting style becomes the fighting style of the final boss for both you and all future players of the game, until it is defeated and replaced. the final boss will get progressively harder the longer the game exists.
 
A Burnout-style racing game in which half of the racers drive in the opposite direction. 
Each deathrace starting line has half of the racers facing the opposite direction. In a 3-lap race, racers would have to face bouts of deadly head-on collisions about 6 times.****All racing mechanics would be designed around this single concept. Control is tight and immediate. Head-on collisions send both cars straight into the air, so driving behind another car is a safety tactic... while playing chicken with an opposing vehicle (turning at the last second) is a counter-tactic. Crashes are visually spectacular with violent explosions, screen shake and excess debris on the track.Some tracks would be designed to have straightaways along the expected "danger zones". Other tracks make those areas more perilous. For example: Corners that force racers to either the faster inner raceline or the safer outer edge, hills that obscure the oncoming racetrack, branching paths that split into tight corridors, or a combination of any and all of these.To raise the tension, seconds before a wave of opposing racers you will get a loud warning of oncoming traffic. **Shit is about to go down.**
 
A new 'X-Files' game but with graphics/art style of a PS1 game, like the original Silent Hill 
Been binging the show a lot so came up with this idea.The concept is just to create a new mystery in the style of one of the 'monster-of-the-week' type episodes, with a spate of unexplained murders, which Mulder and Scully investigate.Has L.A. Noire-type investigation, but your prompted responses differ depending on if you're Mulder or Scully, with Mulder being more focused on some wild theory, and Scully trying to find a more down-to-earth rationale. Maybe pepper in easter eggs throughout about a greater conspiracy, but keep it a short game adapting just one monster mystery.
 
You play a psychic detective that can live through the final moments of victims to find clues to their whereabouts or their killer. You aren't aware of this until after living through the final moments of some poor soul in the horror game's terrifying opening segment. 
EDIT: By "you aren't aware" I meant the player isn't aware of this framing device at the start of the game. The game starts *in medias res*.The detective part is very limited; basically just your character in some disheveled room with walls covered in news clippings, a map, photographs, mementos and other clues. All you get to do in this segment of the game is to make connections on that wall with pins and string [like this.](https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/15/37/original/original-detective-crazy-wall-43-jpg-f48b090a.jpg) You can psychic dive into mementos of victims to play & replay the horror segments in search of clues that will help you find more connections. All the cases appear to be connected, and you're certain the killer is somewhere on your wall.There are only two big problems:1. After years of reliving moments of the dead, the dead are starting to show up more often in the detective's visions. Perhaps even in real life too.2. It's becoming clear the killer has paranormal abilities too.
 
A farming game in which you've genetically modified your crops...TO FIGHT BACK! 
#### "GMOffensive"You're a new farmer in a slice of life town. Your crops keep getting raided by wild animals and monsters; even your cows are being abducted by aliens. You've had enough. So, as an ex-mad scientist, you start splicing DNA into your corn and cabbage to have claws and fangs. You give your tomatoes and potatoes whips and venom. You turn your cows into kung-fu cows.****Every morning you get up to water your crops, milk your cows, harvest ripe crops, plant new seeds, and **prepare them for the nightly battles.** The first half of the day plays like a slice of life farming game (Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley) including the interactions with the town's NPCs, while the last portion plays like a tower defense game (Plants vs. Zombies) and is the secret you keep from the townspeople. During the latter portion, you'll run around in your fields supporting your crops and fighting enemies with your own farming tools and weapons.Now you aren't just organizing your crop placement for efficiency, but also for maximum defense. Do you plant in rows easier to water, or a maze more difficult for enemies to pass? Do you choose which plants to sow for their profitability or their defensive capabilities?Each crop (and animal) has traits that they can pass down to their offspring. Poison damage? Shooting projectiles? Higher damage/defense? All those are traits that can be randomly inherited. Instead of selling your best crops, you can also choose to use them to seed the next generation to continually upgrade them. You don't even need to breed from the same species... you're a mad scientist! You can crossbreed the fire breathing attack from your pigs to give to your turnips. Just be sure to water the surrounding crops.The game is half farming & breeding lab, and half action tower defense.
 
What If You Could Make A Horror Game Out Of Cancelled Horror Game Demos? 
I know it's not realistically possible, given legalities, but I'd LOVE if there was a way to combine demos from cancelled horror games into one big playable compilation. Essentially, it would be an interactive anthology experience made out of what would have become games. *Silent Hills*' *P.T.* & the currently presumably dead *Allison Road* would've been prime candidates (among others). Hypothetically, the main menu would have all the *"levels"* available to choose from in any order to play one at a time.&#x200B;Or, you could go through them all in a randomized order. If you decided on the latter, then completing one demo would seamlessly transition you into the next, ideally building suspense as to which might follow. Aside from some polish to any technical hiccups that may have been present in the original demos, they'd play exactly the same way. Upon finishing them all, you'd receive a *"Thank You"* from each developer in the credits. It just sucks to see so many promising projects forgotten over time.
 
A game where you can swap minds with native people or animals or whatever in its world 
You'll encounter someone, let's say a villager, and you'll be able to transfer your mind and control him instead of your previous body, than you'll meet a bird and you will swap minds with him and you'll be able to fly anywhere!I think such a game would be pretty awesome 😀But I don't have time to make it, I am actually working on two games at once atm. Finishing one and beginning another. And I have plans for next 2 games to make.
 
Battle Royal style game where the losers respawn as zombies 
Imagine a Battle Royale game where instead of being eliminated when you die you continue playing as a zombie. The game wouldn't even need the shrinking circle of death. The map becomes more hostile to the surviving players due to an increasing number of zombie players. To discourage camping the longer a survivor stays in one spot, the closer to that spot the zombies can spawn.This idea was inspired by Zombie Tag the playground/camp game.[greatcampgames.ca/tag-games/zombie-tag/](https://greatcampgames.ca/tag-games/zombie-tag/)
 
A reverse horror game in which you play as the monster and have to horrify and kill victims. 
A single-player game in which you must sneak around while murdering a number of victims, likely very many. It's unlikely you'll ever be at threat of death, although you can only take so much punishment(or maybe if the game goes too long the victims can discover your weakness). Instead, the objective is to get high grades, similar to a beat-'em-up. Your are graded on the timing and efficacy of your 'scares'. Generating the most possible fear in the victim, keeping a good time, variety of kills used, etc. are all areas on which you are judged. It'd be cool if the game had the option to cut your gameplay into actual short movies, too.I am aware of Carrion, by the way, and you can probably guess I'm really excited for it.Edit: I'm also aware of Dead by Daylight, the issue with Dead by Daylight is that it isn't scary or fun or anything else good.
 
Superhero RPG where the difficulty is in learning to control your growing strength to prevent collateral damage 
As the player goes through the game, their power grows to a point where fighting enemies mostly becomes trivial, but ensuring the safety of the people and city becomes increasingly difficult.
 
A game where you are in a school of barracuda 
I had a weird game idea from this dream I had. So you swim at high speeds in a large group of barracuda. Everyone plays their own fish and your main goal is to try and stay in the center of the school where it's safest. Food will come across and eating food will increase your size making it easier for  you to push smaller fish to the outside of the school. You can also work together with other fish to push fish that are heavier than you. Also predators will come. From sharks, to whales, and even fishing nets. They'll either take some fish off the outside of the group or with the whales they will remove large chunks of the entire group.  Last 10 fish remaining will come across a safe coral reef and win.
 
A horror game based on the Alma Glitch from F.E.A.R. 2, in which an NPC relentlessly walks toward you throughout the entire game. It's the premise of the movie It Follows but in video game form. 
[This is the Alma Glitch I'm talking about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQZygxNUjZg) Another video of it [can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77wpwlnwD0) Here's [a better quality video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj7KKHi6OIE)This game would be an otherwise typical action horror game with side objectives and exploration; however, early in the game the player begins being stalked by a supernatural entity that is always moving toward him with steady, unnatural movement. It can't be stopped. If it reaches you, it will kill you and corrupt the two most recent checkpoint save files. Trying to reuse the latest save files will make the stalker more aggressive and unpredictable, or you can simply load an older save file and lose substantially more progress.The maps of the games would be designed to explore, but many areas lead to dead ends. Corridors are especially terrifying if you don't know whether or not they lead anywhere. Side objectives and some primary objectives are placed in such precarious dead ends, making you question how far the stalker is and thus how much time you have to run in and out.Talking to NPCs will lock you into the conversation and tight camera angles so you can't easily tell if you're in danger or not. You can skip past dialogue if you're in a hurry, but you can't tell if you'll have skipped important information. As the camera cuts during dialogue, you might see nothing behind you but on the second cut to your character you see the stalker emerge past a doorway into your area.Pause menus pause all gameplay... except for the stalker. It keeps moving.
 
A Game where every time you die you take on aspects and traits of the enemy/enemies that kill you eventually resulting in permadeath. 
I'm picturing a game like Dark Souls in terms of difficulty and Lore.  You the player must travel through a twisted and corrupt world doing battle with various mythical twisted creatures.  The difference is when you die you get corrupted ever so slightly taking on the features of the creature maybe even gaining some special abilities. Die too many times and you'll suffer from permanent corruption becoming a mindless mini boss at the place where you died.  The player then shifts to a new body a fresh blood clean and uncorrupted human.    
 
A horror sim game in which you play as a witch in Late Medieval Europe, you can cast spells, bewitch the townspeople, curse their crops/livestock/children, craft potions, create a coven, commune with demons - all while avoiding detection during the height of the witch-burning hysteria. 
This is my first post on this sub, so apologies if I get the formatting wrong!The game would have a rich character creation mechanic that would impact gameplay and storylines; for example an attractive witch might be more adept at seducing other people, while an old crone or geezer might have an easier time hiding in plain sight. Vampirism, lycanthropy and other shape-shifting abilities could also add to the player character’s options about what their perfect witch would be.  There would be a variety of skills that the player could master: conjugation, numerology, astrology, curses/hexes, transformation and shape-shifting, clairvoyance, necromancy, healing, potion crafting, medicine, offensive magic, telepathy and mind control, flight, resurrection, summoning, luck manipulation, ancient languages, animal familiars, and so much more. These skills could be learned and improved through different rituals or through books and grimoires. About the animal familiars, I think that they would be a fun game mechanic as the player could capture and nurture a familiar such as a cat, wolf, deer, serpent, raven, etcetera and train them to do their bidding, eventually getting to a point in which they can psychically “see” through the eyes of their animal familiar. Summoning entities would play a large part in gameplay, with the player being able to conjure demons that grant special powers/buffs/items or protect the player by attacking/possessing enemies. Necromancy would allow the player to resurrect the dead to serve as servants or assassins. The player could also commune with the dead to discover secrets they could use to their advantage. Crafting would be a huge part of the game, with potions, rituals spells requiring either growing ingredients oneself, buying or trading for them, or foraging for them in the environment. I’ve been doing reading about the kinds of herbs used by midwives and doctors in the 16th Century and I would apply this information into the game. (I’m a huge fan of inventory items in games that have deep lore and backstories for every single item, I feel like it adds to much in terms of world-building.)The player could join a coven or build one of their own followers, start wars with other covens, infiltrate a coven to take it over or destroy it from the inside-out. Lots of interesting story quests could come out of this mechanic. Or, the player could wield power through more legitimate in the “surface world” by becoming the court astrologer for a duke or becoming renowned and wealthy for selling tonics and tinctures with healing properties. Or, the player could just lie/steal/murder/magic/seduce/talk your way to the top, there would be so many different ways to play through the game. You could spend the game as a white witch growing herbs and making a fortune selling potions and the occasional love spell; or, you could summon Beelzebub and have entire cities under your thrall. The main challenge of the game would come from trying to do all these things undetected, which is difficult as even a rumor amongst the townsfolk could send you to the gallows or the stake. But as your skill set grows you can get to a point in which you are undetectable to any inquisitor, or - so powerful that armies fear you and you can do whatever you want openly; or, you become so charismatic that you charm even the pope and become the most powerful woman or man in Europe. I’ve been thinking about this game idea for quite a while and I think it could be a really appealing concept! I think it’d be really interesting to play a character that does things that are normally portrayed in video games as being “villainous”. There’s also something kind of subversive about having a game in which the main point is to undermine rigid puritanical and patriarchal systems.   Anyways, I just wanted to see if anyone else would be interested in a game like this and I’d love any suggestions or ideas about what to change, add or subtract. Thank you so much!
 
Metroidvania where the unlockables are really basic things like entering doors and accessing the menu 
I'm playing Evoland right now, which is very interesting but is more of a joke than a really deep game.  What I'm thinking is a more fully-fleshed-out exploration-based MV where the unlockables include really, really basic stuff like the map, the ability to single jump, the ability to run, the ability to play sound, etc., but in a way where you have to actually work to find these abilities.  Maybe you could play as a robot that can find attachments such as a map chip, a bouncy wheel (to replace the existing wheel), a larger wheel (to go faster with the same RPM), a microphone (to hear sound), etc.  Interestingly enough, there are already some games that explore this, like La-Mulana, where you have to unlock a lot of basic features at the beginning (in the original freeware version you even have to unlock saving, but thankfully you do start out with the ability to jump).  However, once you unlock these features in La-Mulana in the first hour or so of gameplay, they (almost) never become relevant again.  It would be very interesting to have a game where you're unlocking this kind of thing the whole way through.  One such ability to unlock could be the ability to switch off some ability you've previously collected.  The original Metroid did not have this ability (actually, neither does La-Mulana 1), and you needed the Ice Beam to beat the game, so if you ended up with the Wave Beam, which replaced the Ice Beam, you had to go and find another Ice Beam.  A similar mechanic could exist in this game until you acquire that ability to switch between abilities you've collected.Ideas for abilities: improved vision modules (with better resolution, better colors, ability to see IR or UV), microphones for the sound effects or music (where platforms are synced to the music), olfactory modules (to identify poison gas or flowers or whatever), a weapons module (a good chunk of the game needs to be playable without it), upgrades to said weapons module, the ability to access a menu (pausing should always be possible; don't screw over the player), the ability to run, the ability to jump, the ability to double jump (or a jetpack or something), a grapple module (unless it's too derivative, which is fine), the ability to see which upgrades you have, the ability to switch on/off which upgrades you have, the ability to access extra options on the upgrades you have, the obvious armor upgrades and weapon power upgrades and maybe a range of weapons to use that could include consumables, the ability to use bombs and such, the ability to look at a map (La-Mulana and Hollow Knight have this), the ability to see an upgraded map that maybe has your current location on it (La-Mulana and Hollow Knight have this too), the ability to shine a light (might want to switch it off when enemies are attracted to it), the ability to change the color of the light (including to IR or UV), and so on.All of these abilities can be used to solve puzzles; they can all be reflected in the character's sprite/model; there are enough of them to keep exploration rewarding.  You could even have a system where you don't actually carry your old upgrades around with you; when you get a new one, you drop the old one that was in that same slot.  One map upgrade could show you the locations of these dropped upgrades; another upgrade could be a bag that can hold some amount of upgrades (possibly in a spatial inventory puzzle), which can itself be upgraded.  Upgrades could make your character too big to fit through some spaces, requiring you to remove them before you can go in.I think there's a lot of possibility here for a deep and engaging game with this concept.  It's not radical and several games have used elements of this (other examples: Ori doesn't start out letting you attack; Metroid makes you get the Long Shot; Legend of Zelda starts you without even a sword; obviously Evoland is the inspiration here), but no game that I've played (and I haven't played Evoland 2) has made significant use of these beyond the first hour of gameplay.  Hollow Knight and La-Mulana are the games that, I think, go the furthest in making the player earn basic things, though in both cases, the upgrades are mostly purchased in the starting town rather than given as rewards for exploration.  But can you imagine if La-Mulana started out *without* you having the whip or the Mobile Super X, the two things you start with?
 
A flowchart for enemies in a stealth game - use it however you like! 
 
Dad Fighter. That old childhood debate: "my dad could totally beat up your dad. 
This game would mimic Pokémon style exploration, battles, and tournaments, but with real-time Street Fighter style combat. Different than Pokémon, every child (players/NPCs) only has one "monster" -- their dad. Could also include a "single mom" option.Instead of exploring forests, you'd explore your local public park. Instead of exploring jungles, you'd explore city blocks of the concrete jungle -- during a visit downtown. Other areas might include: an art museum, a zoo, a carnival, a theme park, a beach, etc. You get the point. These areas would appear to be vast like the Pokémon regions because they're being viewed from a kid's perspective.Instead of having multiple dads with different abilities, you would level up your singular dad with new abilities, attacks, stat upgrades, and cosmetic accessories (sunglasses, baseball cap, etc). Maybe there are classes of dads to pick from at the beginning of the game that determine your initial build.Dads would be extreme caricatures of themselves, and would come off as dramatically charismatic heroes/villains. They'd let their kids coach them in battle as if they were Pokémon. Gameplay-wise, you would simply take control of your dad while your in-game avatar appears to be coaching in the background.Perhaps there could also be special/super attacks that involve the child and dad teaming up to deal the blow. That could be neat.P.s. the concept for this game was directly inspired by u/coreyredditdraw OC on r/characterdrawing. I've gotta give credit where it's due. https://www.reddit.com/r/characterdrawing/comments/frgsoq/oc_dad_fighter/
 
Fantasy tourism sim. Explore strange worlds with fascinating cultures, do local jobs to earn your keep, and buy souvenirs. 
This could possibly be procedurally generated - then the voyage would never have to end - but it might be more plausible to make it by hand, given how hard it would be to procedurally generate interestingly distinct worlds. (Example: No Man's Sky.) The main difference with games that already exist would be that the *only thing you're doing* is travelling and collecting stuff. There would be nothing else to the game but that. Walking simulator style. Maybe it's a space voyage - or maybe it's on oceangoing vessels sailing up and down a seemingly infinite coast, with each new town different from the last. An eternal cruise! (This would be even better in VR.)As for the local odd jobs - no typical RPG stuff. No "quests". This isn't adventuring - it's a vacation. Maybe the "local jobs" could be represented by some kind of mobile casual game which you can play whenever you have time, and points you earn there become in game money to be used during longer, settled play sessions at your computer, to pay for things like food, shelter, souvenirs, and tickets to your next destination.A social element could be included as well, since there are presumably other tourists on the ship(s) with you. When you're going to your next destination (how long does that take? depends on the timing of when people tend to play, I guess) you might wander around on board chatting with other players who are online at the time. And in towns you could chat with players who are spending time there, and maybe coordinate your exploration. (No NPC tour guides though. But maybe players who are very familiar with an area could make a little industry for themselves...)You might even be able to save up enough money to buy a quaint little seaside cottage and start fixing it up... start a bakery that other players can visit... fall in love with a mysterious foreign prince... and all of a sudden it's a Hallmark movie! :P
 
Deathmatch, one bullet at a time. 
Picture a game like Counterstrike or Quake, in a deathmatch game with 6 players. Everyone has a pistol that can kill with one shot. But here's the twist: there's only one bullet on the whole map at a time, one bullet for all 6 players. You can't tell if you have it, unless you fire it. If you press the trigger without the bullet, nothing happens. If you fire a test shot, you risk wasting your one chance. If you miss, you hope the person you missed doesn't have the bullet next. Once someone fires the bullet, the bullet is silently given to a random player. A notification appears to all players that the bullet has been dispensed, but it doesn't name any names.It's sort of a social, reversed Russian roulette. Do you play defensively or aggressively? Do you form adhoc alliances? Do you play it fast paced, or stealthily?Tagged as beginner, because it be done as a mod for most FPSs.
 
Neuromancer 
A game where you design and modify individual connections between neurons to change certain behaviors in NPCs. It could be a a standing puzzle game or a sort of minigame inside a bigger rpg, in wich magic can physically affect minds.
 
We really need an archery FPS today 
I'm tired of guns. I'd even play blowdart fps. Lol
 
Zombie City game with some degree of takeover progress 
I love zombie games, but hate that when I leave an area I've cleared and come back, it's filled with zombies again. So how about this: a zombie City game with an element of a takeover type mechanic. You start off in like a hospital or something, boarded up windows etc, and have to clear out the immediate street of zombies, which then gives you access to the houses and buildings in that street for materials to build a barrier you place at the end of the street to keep it as "taken over". If you don't build the barrier fast enough, the zombies flood back in. The houses which you've now "unlocked" have trapped people you've now rescued to add to your party, as well as resources like food, water, medical supplies, ammo. Then you work your way through the next street and so on and so forth. The final objective could maybe to be to either clear the whole city, or carve a safe path to an exit out of the city, or maybe to save a loved one on the other side of the city.  Each area you unlock could have characters with their own objectives, stories etc, as well as access to better gear (weapons and ammo at the police station, food at the supermarket, etc). Also, just 1 type of zombies: runners. 28 days layer style. No super zombies that are muscly and tough, no fat zombies that puke on you, just hundreds and hundreds of runner zombies that shriek as they run and alert other zombies to follow. You trip 1 off, the whole horde is sprinting at you. Also, they can attack barriers which have a limited time/health before they break and the zombies flood back in and you basically lose that street. Your rescued party members will defend, but if the barrier breaks, they'll fall back and some might die. If you've decided to use the materials from the previous barrier to build the new front line barrier and it breaks, you will lose that street too or as many streets as are left without barriers so material management is required. With all those running zombies that can swarm you in an instant, it becomes clear how little time you actually have to clear an area and get a barrier up before you're overrun and pushed back again. I'd like to imagine a worthwhile strategy would be to get the barrier up at the end of the street as your party members cover you to create a "kill zone", and then clear out all the stragglers within it. Materials used for barriers can include classic things like wood planks and corrugated metal sheeting, but also include skips (heavy and slow to move), cars, portions of metal fences, and other things to reinforce it and make it stronger. All materials you and your party have to physically carry or move around instead of just some green silhouette and a "place here" button. Ammo is scarce and basic until you get to the police station (or military base?) So you'll have to rely on melee weapons alot too (think Dead Rising where everything is pretty much a weapon). All of this, I imagine as an FPS style, so like zombie games like Left 4 Dead, Dead Island, Dying Light, those kind of things. Rival hostile humans could be a thing, or friendly groups to link up with, or maybe several groups with their own politics where if you help group A, group B turns hostile cos they hate group A or something maybe different groups have different advantages. Some are military or police, some are gangsters, some are useless. I dunno. Maybe have the individual people you rescue have different skills too that help if you assign them to the correct role, some build faster, carry more materials, scavenge more stuff, can attack really well but can't defend as well or vice versa, have medical skills, use less food when theyre cooking meals for everyone, farming skills, move faster, better firearm handling or use melee better...Think I've rambled a heck load there. But this idea I've sat on for years and it all just kinda spilled out, so I apologise if i seem to jump from one idea to the next and back like a hyperactive kid whose go into thebsugar bag.  there's bits I've forgot, so if things don't seem fully thought through.. they once were.. Let me know thoughts and ideas on this.Edit: if I've literally just word-for-word described a game that already exists, please gimme the name.. It would clearly be my ideal zombie game and I'm obviously not already aware of it.
 
A game where you are a birdwatcher, looking down on a park, and you witness people and animals going about their days 
I was thinking the other day about how to combine my loves for slow, relaxing games; collecting games; and games with interweaving plot lines. I came up with this:you are a birdwatcher, up on a bluff that overlooks a large city park. You look down on the park, and can use your binoculars to zoom in. A clock is also always visible on screen. You can see birds, animals, families, couples, etc., all doing various things. All the events that transpire are pre-scripted and planned to be interesting and engaging, and they are automatically recorded in your journal when you witness them. For example: if a small chipmunk catches your eye, you might follow him for a while as he gathers nuts, until he suddenly is swiped up by a hawk that dives in from high above. Your notes pop up: "11:32 am - hawk kills chipmunk." You hear a child crying, and you pan over to see that a child was watching the chipmunk too, and was sad to see it killed. You could then follow the hawk and see where it goes with its kill, or you could follow the family and see how they calm the child down, or you could decide you're done with that story and try to find something else. Restarting the game, you could find the child before he sees the kill, and see what he is up to before he starts crying. Maybe he's happily playing with a friend earlier in the day, and you can then decide to follow the friend and see what he gets up to. The game is designed to be high in replayability in this way. You can follow dozens of different stories and characters throughout the day at the park, and the game could even be extended to be several days, and you could follow story threads from day to day. Maybe a couple is going through a breakup, and you can see how their actions from day to day reflect that situation. For completionists' sake, there is a journal that records all activity and characters that you have seen. Filling that up, and figuring out how to do it quickly via pattern memorization, could be another level of challenge for people who don't like to just observe. This game concept opens the door to unique experiences for each person playing, even though all events are scripted, making it ideal for the current "experience"-based gaming climate. Everyone would want to try it out to see what unique events they can find, but no one would ever feel like they were losing out on anything, because the scripted nature makes it easy to look up a walkthrough. It has opportunities for humor, emotion, and excitement, and scratches the itch for relaxing and collecting. This could even be easily converted to VR.Now if only I had any talent for programming...
 
A co-op game where one player assumes the role of "mission control 
I had this idea while playing Payday, which, for those who don't know, is a 4-player co-op game where each level is a different career-criminal heist, ranging from bank robbery, to abducting a meth lab's money-filled panic room, to interrupting an IRS deal to share data with a corporation in order to share the data with another client. Throughout each mission, the players are guided by an unseen individual named Bain, who scans police radio for incoming attack information, manages assisting characters (getaway drivers, helicopter pilots, etc), and generally keeps the player characters informed.In this idea, one player takes Bain's role in the mission. They're provided with things like a police radio, manuals for tools, camera feed tablets, etc, and utilize those items to guide the players through missions that never go quite the same way twice, somewhat in the vein of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, albeit with more variety than just a single manual.For the "mission control" player, it would probably make for an interesting VR game as well.
 
I suck at ideas... but i made a prototype. What kind of game can this turn into? 
Please allow me to show you this video, a prototype I built two years ago:https://youtu.be/D8E2TfWcCXASince I’m just one person, I dont think “an open world space trading sim like Eve” would be feasible. but perhaps some other smaller scales game can be made from this core gameplay? I appreciate any brainstorming ideas:) thank you!
 
How about a game about you fighting with multiple characters against an overpowered enemy 
Ok so I just watched john wick 3 and I was thinking "how shit must it be to be a cop in this universe" and then it came to me. A game where you are some form of authority and then a Jhon wick kinda guy comes along and fucks everything up now you have to stop him. Story:The story will go along the lines of those story game, such as "heavy rain". You have multiple characters that try to get a guy who has done something to anger them, or something completely different.Let's take further inspiration from John Wick. Let's say there is this massive Assasin organization and there is this assassin that is supposed to kill someone, he succeeded but now he has a bounty on his head. Now you don't play that guy. You play the people who either want to get him for money, justice, or just personal reasons. You can play as a cop who was there during the assassination and now has an obsession with the assassin. You are the son of the one who the assassin killed and now you want revenge. You are an older man who wants to kill the Assasin because he killed someone you loved. Ect. In some parts, you trace the chaos the assassin has left behind much like John Wick would and you constantly cross paths with him. In some parts, you are trying to figure out more about the assassin to find out what his next move could be. And in some parts, you will be with an entire swat team trying to kill the assassin in one of his many hideouts. Gameplay: This idea mostly borrows from other games. I was mostly inspired by games such as "watch_dogs" "sleeping dogs" "yakuza" "heavy rain" "resident evil 3" and more. So it's pretty much a mishmash of things. All I know is that I want the assassin or whatever you put in place of it to be OP and practically unbeatable until the end and even then I want it to be hard as balls. The "Assasin" behaves very much behaves a lot you would play with an action hero, you know super badass, Nathen drake, Max Payne, solid snake, Sam Fisher, agent 47, etc. he can just do about anything, he is a marksman, parkour genius, smooth talker, stealth master, etc. This doesn't mean he can't die though he is still human and he also makes mistakes. But this all depends on your characters. Let's say one of your characters (let's say a mafia member) shoots the assassin but only hits the back of his feat, boom there is now a trail of blood one of the other characters (a detective) finds or some DNA. Btw your characters have only one life, so if one of them dies you can't use them again and it will affect the story. The game is basically supposed to feel like you are playing chess, however, most of your pieces are just pawns and your opponent has nothing but a queen and your playing against "deep blue". Conclusion:I am not expecting anyone to make a game anything like this it just seemed like a fun idea and I liked writing it. If you have any additions to the idea please comment I would love to write a book about it and more inspiration is always better. If there is a game like this, please tell me what it Is so I can play it.Edit: I see i made some writing mistakes, il fix them later, i was writing this on a phone.
 
Hotel Transylvania 
Watching hotel Transylvania with my daughters I couldn't belive this does not have a game. I can imagine a hotel management type game. The games main premise is of course building, expanding and operating a monster hotel. The could be side objectives for example keeping the humans away from the hotel. Additional objectives could also be hosting famous monsters that will review the hotel and could lead to an increase or drop in clientele.
 
A guideline for game ideas. 
I browsed this subreddit for a bit and it did not seem like anyone made a template / structure on how a good game idea is supposed to look. I figured to make one myself and help others out here share game ideas that other developers might bring to life. So, here is a sort of "guide" you can follow to make ideas that you'd wanna see happen. There will be examples and summary at the bottom. Enjoy.___#[The Idea Structure | 4 Ws]Every good game idea has these. The 4Ws are..**WHO / The Protagonist - Who the player is playing****WHAT / The Concept - What the game is about****WHERE / The Location - Where is it based in****WHY / The Purpose - What makes the game special**BONUS: **The Antagonist - Who opposes the player**(Some games don't really need an antagonist, which is why it is a bonus. All of the games need something or someone that you play, a concept of what is it about, the location where it is in and purpose to keep the player invested)____#[LINES > WALLS | The Elevator Pitch]I'll be honest. If I see game ideas with walls of text, I'm just not gonna read through it at all. I close them quickly. **The best game ideas are the ones that are found in the title itself. If you can't put your game idea in the title then it is probably not a good game idea.** Your game ideas should be described quickly and coherently. They should sound fun and interesting so the other person might want to go "okay, but tell me more".**Examples of AAA games**RPG, you play as Dovahkiin, a dragon slayer, and the location is in a northern area. You fight actual dragons and get superpowers. (Skyrim)You play as a master assassin killing important historical figures in historical places, you can parkour across rooftops. (Assassin's Creed)You are a fat Italian plumber who is playing in a Mushroom World stomping your enemies & your goal is to save a Princess who is your girlfriend. (Super Mario)___#[VAGUE IDEAS > STATIC IDEAS | Don't overdetail your ideas]*i got this new anime plot. basically theres this high school girl except shes got huge boobs. i mean some serious honkers. a real set of badonkers. packin some dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos. big old tonhongerekoogers.. What happens next?! transfer student shows up one day with even bigger bonkhonagahoogs. **HUMUNGOUS** hungolomghnonoloughongous!!!*Your ideas should have a structure but completely static ideas are not good. Good ideas are described in a few seconds so you get the gist of it & they are not concrete in of itself. The best game ideas are where you don't need to put a specific face or style on your protagonist. Think of it like modern art (except it doesnt sucks ass HURRRIWENTTHERE) where different people see it in a different way.(However, if you are sharing a game idea that IS about putting a specific style of character because it matters to the thing as a whole, then go ahead and add that.. but you need a WHY and it needs to be explained in a couple of words)___#[Stories are the topping | The game is the cake]The game is what the player will be experiencing the vast majority of the time spent PLAYING. Even games that people gush about for their stories are backed up with good games. Skyrim, Legend of Zelda, Shadow of Collossus, Mass Effect (the old ones, coughcough), Assassins Creed (the old ones, hackcoughhack) all had fun gameplays to back up the story. My point is that I really don't care about your story, your character called Azazael and how he is on an RPG quest to slay the E P I C O Demon from Seven Pits Of Hell. If your game sucks, a lot  of people will give up on it. However, if your story sucks, most people will not really give a shit if the gameplay itself is good. There are a lot of games out there with pitiful stories but that are just fun as fuck to play.. so people play them.Good Game + Good Story = Amazing Game (95% of people will like it)Good Game + Meh Story = Nice Game (80% of people will like it)Bad Game + Good Story = Meh Game (20% of people will like it)Bad Game + Bad Story = Terrible Game (Your mom and family members will pretend to like it)And yes, some people like to just eat the whipcream from the bowl and some people like to play visual hentai novels. Most people prefer to eat the cake itself so your idea needs to be focused on THE GAME. You WILL have an audience for it if your game is very low but your story is nice.. but not as much as if your actual game & mechanics of it are good. So focus on the game itself.#[Don't share stuff that is overly personal to you | Concepts are less emotional]There is some stuff that people hold dear and close to their heart and they want to see it made. The problem with this is that they have a clear, specific, iron based design that does not let the developer fuck with it much. **You can share your ideas here if you'd like** but they don't make for good game ideas for most people since they don't think the way you think about the thing you love. Good game ideas are the ones where people can put their own spin to it, and the ones where the creator didn't envision the whole story from start to finish.___#[Great Examples - From Top of All Time]So, here are some really good examples from this subreddit. You can picture all of these games in your head without needing much explanation, it sounds fun to play & all of them have titles (Humble Peasant is a good game title) within the description(s). All of them describe the core game within a few dozen words.**Humble Peasant**: You play as a humble peasant (WHO) who must fight off waves of adventurers (WHAT & WHY) who feel entitled to just waltz into your house (WHERE) and loot whatever they please.**Last Parking Spot**: A racing (WHO / car) game where players compete to get the last parking spot (WHAT) across town (WHERE) in a ruthless Battle Royale musical chairs format (WHY) with brutal collision physics.**A Band of Goblins:** You are a band of goblins (WHO) and must stop a group of adventurers (WHAT & WHY) from completing their quests (WHERE) by scouting, ambushing, and trapping them along their way.___#[WHAT NOW?]Now it is your turn to follow this and create your own game idea for others to mess with. It might sound easy but, trust me, forming an idea in a short sentence can be really difficult. So, here is a summary of everything listed.* Use the 4 Ws (WHO / WHAT / WHERE / WHY);* Remember to be short with it;* Be vague but not too vague;* Focus on the game and not on the story;* Don't hold emotional attachment to the idea.
 
Survival game set in japan (Shizen to no kyōsei) 
So obviously this game is a triple A title and I am only posting this because I need to get the idea out. I recently read somewhere that the japanese seas have a abundant amount of fish living in them and me being a big fan of fishing in games and a big fan of japanese food, thought of this game idea.The game would be set in japan a while ago, and would be an open world survival game. The emphasis in development would lie on the visual aspect and the fishing mechanic. Your best source of food would be fishing, you would live on a house boat and the map would be parted into the four different islands japan consists of, each representing a different biotope and therefore presenting different flora and fauna. The game would be in a non-realistic artstyle that for example "Rare ent" nailed very well (sea of thieves, grounded). The map would be filled with ancient temples, shrines and small self-sustaining villages to explore. Anyways, this is just a dream I had that I needed to tell to someone. Please, feel free to comment down below and add features or correct stuff. I'd love to hear from you guys.
 
War game, where you are the tailor/supplier of equipment for the army 
Instead of being the general or commander or such, leading the army, you are the person tasked equiping the army of various supplies.At the start of the war, that is like a year before actual conflict, you only have select items to use, which are a basic uniform, a standart rifle/weapon, bedroll, tiny mess kit and such. You research new equipment of your choice, maybe even try something experimental.You decide which equipment is needed, at what time, at what place and is it either too much or little. You design the soldier's gear and various specialites, the field infirmary, the field kitchen and what vehicles to use. Not tanks or artillery, trucks tasked with hauling all that stuff around.What equipment you use and how much of it will affect how the war goes. Give too little and they can't fight, give too much and they're overburdened,give too old and thet out-classed, let them starve and they don't have energy, give a lot food and it'll spoil thus affecting funds, give improper clothing and they'll freeze/burn up. You get the picture, give the correct stuff and you'll succeed.Edit: as always, check the comments for idea polishing and extra information
 
Violent grocery shopping. 
3rd person action rpg/"simulation"The hub would function like angband where you have a house in a world that is dynamic due to randomly triggered events at set points of the game, these will include different merchants and bandits and not much else. Very simple.The grocery store would be the dungeon where you must fight through waves of shoppers to get a nice ham at the bottom of the dungeon after fighting Mecha-Karen. The dungeon will not proc gen it's structure and will be very small, most likely only 3 levels but will proc gen enemies and items besides the boss.Basic leveling including strength, dextarity and intelligence which determine how you will do damage, defenses will be handled by armor and a fighting skill that can be leveled much like a few classic ASCII games.Weapons and gear would range from mall swords and siiiiiiick dusters all the way up to plate armor and glocks. That's about it, this will be the first solo project I undertake. I have made games before but never alone.
 
A game where you are stick figures that have to survive in games they aren't meant for 
Like the story is you live in computer and go on adventures through different games
 
Are gameideas more about story or gameplay? 
As someone who really focus on the gameplay it feels weird to see every ideas being more about story than anything.Like you can tell me your game is a fps in a cyberpunk futur where you have to make deals with cyberlords to make money. And I still have no idea what the game is.And why do people seams to be okay with that? For me a good gameidea is when you can understand some of the gameplay loops, or the main one at least. "You have to travel in your armored car throught deserts to reach new cities in order to refuel and get new parts for *amazing task you have to do*". Just that would be enought even if it doesn't explain how you deal with the travelling part, because you have one loop, a part with no ressources, the desert, and the opposite with the cities. You can already imagine that both places have very different dangers and goals, co-dependent of each other. And you have a main goal.
 
Survival horror game set in cave 
Game that has claustrophobic atmosphere, the player is being constantly chased, some small tunnels to fit through, and gears that helps the player temporarily.
 
A game where you play as a cult fighting against other cults and the local government for control of the town/nation/whatever. 
Think a weird mix of CK2 and cultist simulator. Most of the map would be made of government/tiles at the beginning with each player starting with one tile, but you will not be able to immediately see the other cults in a specific tile unless you have planted a mole or encounter their influence. You will slowly spread your influence through force, persuasion, seduction, silent coups, manipulation, and more. &#x200B;The world set I thought of might draw inspiration(plagiarize) from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, miscellaneous horror writers, and set in the modern day, or Victorian Period.&#x200B;Most people would be unaware of magical happenings in the beginning, but would be slowly be: given magic, turned into a vampire, put under some sort of trance, corrupted, killed and resurrected through necromancy, infected with some strange parasite, and maybe more. Players might need to worry about attracting too much attention from people/government, and risk having to fight the government early on. Multiple cults could occupy the same tile and this will drive most of the conflict in the game.
 
Petition to make a "Fangame" flair for the subreddit. 
Upvote if you want this too.
 
A Zelda style RPG game but you're trapped in Ikea 
 
An arena shooter where the faster you go the stronger your gun. 
An arena where the characters are on rollerblades or something and have a gun and the map look something like a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The gun has a base damage but the faster you go the stronger your damage is. Maybe there's some boostpads on the map and sone healthpacks. I think that because going faster can make aiming more difficult it can balance being slower and easier to hit. Maybe at full speed you can one-shot other players. Maybe you can grab power ups to jump or make other players slower.
 
An RPG where your character's face get's destroyed shortly after going through character creation 
I just randomly had this thought that it would be cool if the next Fallout game had your character be a ghoul (basically a man with melted flesh). I think it would be an interesting twist to put on an RPG where your character experience some form of disfigurement to their face. So players don't feel like all their effort is wasted, maybe the disfigurement works around the facial features and stil produces a somewhat unique look based on the character created. Or it could just replace the face entirely with a default face that is the same for all players; maybe the game has some kind of running theme with finding your identity or something.Anyway, just thought it would be a cool twist on modern WRPGs.
 
3 games that link together 
Ok so this is kinda ranty but stick with me.   This would be three different games.   the first would be a resource collecting clicker gamethat game would feed into a base and unit building game.  that game would feed into the third game which would be RTS and first personyou can play all three or just one. If you play all three you can have more options of upgrades. you level up by gathering resources, building successful bases or offensive squads, and attacking enemy bases.   the game divides all players into two sides lets say red and bluethen each team is halved and they are put onto two different planets half The red team is on planet A and the other half is on planet Beach planet is divided in Half by a line. Each team can build on their side up to the line they can only cross the line after the base build time Limit.   they have set time Limits for offensive strikes and then they must defend against the enemy. They take turns attacking and defending until one team dominates one of the planets. once  planet A is dominated by a team any new resources only go to that planet A and the remaining planet B has to survive on its existing resources alone. While the opposing team on planet B gets its full resources sent to the planet Bonce a team has dominated a planet they can start building space units to attack the opposing planet.   team players will be able to vote on when they want to attack the other teams bases and planet. The key will be when to attack or when to defend and what to spend resources on. by working together as a team you can coordinate winning strategy. The final battle will be another attack and defend until one team is victorious.   the Advantage to this game is that it’s component animation and quality can be pretty basic. The draw is in its imaginative properties and its unique cross game platform. anyway I thought I would share in the off chance someone actually understands whatever I’m talking about and thinks it’s cool.   plenty of more free random ideas from a weird thinker.
 
PERMADEATH OR KILL YOURSELF 
First, I'd like to acknowledge that the act of self harm or suicide is very serious. If you or anyone you know is considering these acts please seek help immediately.\*\*GAME IDEA:\*\*A single player story focused stealth Horror FPS about a PC being stalked by monsters. The PC has a revolver with limited ammunition. They may use their bullets to shoot the monsters which only temporarily puts them out of action until it respawns or wakes up. Think Immortal Jack from Resident Evil 7.If the monster kills the player it's permadeath and the player must start the game all over again.If the player is trapped or doesn't think they'll be able to escape the monster then they may kill themselves. This may include jumping to their death from a great height or use one of their bullets to shoot themselves in the head. The player may then continue the game from the last autosaved checkpoint.The conclusion changes depending on the number of times the player has killed themselves such as a bad ending for many suicides or a good ending for none.POST EDIT:For those that dislike the Permadeath idea alternatively when PC is killed by the monster they start from the last autosaved checkpoint but number of times PC killed by monster impacts ending / all of their collected items needed to open a door or solve a puzzle are taken away then player must find them again / monster drags you into a dark cave or something and you have to find your way back to where you were ala "The Forest" and so on and so forth just read the comments
 
play well or get demonetized, a game for streamers. 
the plot is a bit meta. you are a famous youtuber that has got a deal to stream a high tech cutting edge game on youtube for publicity. the problem is in the fine print said the game was nsfw and they are not responsible for any demonetization that comes from that fact.the game would have alot of streaming support and would have 2 modes. 1:real streaming mode, which is meant to be played when you're actually streaming the game. 2:fake streaming mode, which introduces an artificial streaming system with fake people watching the game and a demonetization meter, just to get the full experience if you aren't a streamer.in this game the more mistakes you make, the more nsfw it gets, damage taking off clothes, heavily nsfw game overs, etc. the goal is to play well enough that you can still make ad revenue.i think this theme could be played with in some fun ways, like there being a censor bar power up, or having to defeat a boss before it charges up its yiff beam. that's essentially the premise of the game, feel free to write your thoughts in the comments.
 
A third person/RTS zombie game, with a twist.. 
For this zombie game,  you are the zombie. But not just any zombiev; a zombie overlord whom can control other zombies.  Your zombies come in different strengths and weaknesses.  An example would be the typical slow zombie that is relatively durable. A fast running but weak zombie.  A "hunter"-esque zombie that can stalk victims. Parts if this comes from a cancelled game back in 2007 called Possession. It also allowed to directly  control a single zombie. I think the concept would be refreshing in a market where you are always the "survivor".
 
A pokemon like game but all your monsters and their power levels correspond with a real world stock price 
So you will get different monsters that you can trade, battle, etc but their power levels will always fluctuate according to the stock price they are associated with. Their assigned company will not be obvious so players will have to do research to find which monster is associated with Amazon and the likes. The ensure players don't just get a bunch of blue Chip stocks super fast, they will have to raise certain amounts of in game capital to buy the pokeball/capture device capable of catching such high powered monsters. Upon mergers and acquisitions, the monsters will get merged, making a new one.
 
A farming game except it's a mad rush. Crops grow within seconds and each day is just one minute long. 
What Half-Minute Hero did to RPGs, this game would do to the farm-life genre. It's like a simplified farming game on fast-forward.To keep things simple, you only have about a 20x20 plot of land and the town/shops/NPCs are conveniently right next to it. Every crop takes multiple unique steps from sow to sell and they'll spoil on the vine (or the seeds will be eaten by crows) if you take too long in any step.Every system in this game is designed to keep the player frantic until the end of the 60-second day.After the day is over, the player gets a splash screen and all the time he needs to rest and maybe plan for the next day. Upgrade farm, upgrade tools, level up skills, buy seeds, buy livestock, check on relationship meters, check the weather forecast, plan for tomorrow's objectives, etc. This pause in gameplay would exist for pacing only. After all, the player needs rest between the bursts of anxiety.But as soon as he gets out of that screen, it's another mad dash 60-second farm day.
 
A 2D fantasy game in which you cook and invent new recipes for your town restaurant during the evening, but every morning you forage and hunt for exciting new ingredients in the wildlands. 
Imagine *Moonlighter* but instead of running a shop you run a restaurant, and instead of dungeon crawling you explore a procedurally generated open wilderness teeming with unique plants, animals and monsters.The game focuses on inventing/discovering new recipes. It's not just about what ingredients you combine for a dish, but also about how you prepare or cook each of the ingredients that make the dish unique. It's like if *Breath of the Wild* and *Overcooked* had a top-down 2D baby. Customers request a type of dish (a stew, a roast, a desert, etc.) or type of ingredient (wild game, tree nuts, etc.) and you're allowed to do whatever you want with it. The more intricate the dish, the more you are rewarded. You also slowly discover what ingredients pair well and which don't as you experiment with dishes.On the adventure side you find a vast wilderness with a few set biomes. Early on the hero is limited by the starting inventory capacity, few specialized tools and weaker weapons, along with the player's unfamiliarity and novice skills. As you buy upgrades using the restaurant profits and learn how the wilderness works, you're able to travel further, forage deeper and slay the most dangerous wildlife. Since the world is procedural, you can plant seeds to harvest later. Those plants can attract certain wildlife to hunt later too.
 
Wise words from Miyamoto "You can't just throw every good idea you have into a game. 
 
Bad Game Idea: A backyard baseball sequel where all the kids are now adults who pressure thier kids in performing above their talent level in little league baseball, except Pablo, who is a good dad. 
 
Battle Royale, but on a dodecahedron planet. 
[Here’s the basic idea.](https://i.imgur.com/snAVFki.jpg)  <—linkThe sides of the planet are flat pentagons. These pentagon “tiles” are taken randomly from a bank of designed lands of varying environments (mountains, desert, city etc) that include one or two points of interest.The planet is randomly generated with these tiles every game. High replay value.The storm also is randomly filling one side at a time from the inside out. You never know if the side you are currently on is next. The storm will never make two separate safe zones. Or maybe it can, I don’t know.Last side fills with the storm from the outside, in.That’s it
 
Someone should make a game where your an alien who takes over someone’s body and you have to figure out their routine so nobody figures out your an outsider 
There is so many cool things you could do with a game like this, if someone made a GOOD version of this game I would pay a LOT to play it, that would be so much fun. BTW: not a developer or anything just thought of this idea and wanted to put it out thereEdit: Since I have posted this Among us has blown up, my idea is similar except single player with maybe some sort of story line, and “tasks” would be what your host did before you took control of their body and you figure out from context clues what you’re supposed to do
 
Avoid the Boss 
Concept: You're an employee/intern at an office of some sort with cubicles, offices, coworkers, supervisors, managers, and The Boss.You have specific tasks that need to be completed, but if The Boss finds you, he'll add more to your To Do List and make it a priority to be done before the end of your shift.If he spots someone else that's your level of employee, he'll assign them the task then head back to his office. Maybe grab another assignment to delegate to someone.Using Metal Gear-esque stealth and distraction techniques you avoid The Boss.Doing courtesies for other coworkers (grabbing a cup of coffee/snack) may grant you favors which can be used to delay/detour The Boss.Do your job well enough (earn enough high ranks) will put you in good standing with management, so they might distract The Boss.But there's always the brown-nosers who want praise, and once they spot you will immediately seek out/call The Boss with your current position.As the days go on the office grows (the company building opening up after renovations), first outward, then to different floors, expanding your area of work, places to hide, but also other employees looking to get you "out of their areas."Hide in a storage closet? That'll last until the custodian finds you, and if you're not on their good side they'll start locking them.Trying to wait it out in the server room? Better have treats for the IT gremlins, or else.Maybe there's certain levels that are vacation based, team training outings, office retreats. But guess who tries to make it harder for you? That's right, The Boss.P.S. I'm going to stop here, because I'm starting to ramble.
 
An RTS game where multiple people play as the same nation. One person is in charge of the economy and one is the military general. A 3rd could play as a hero unit and micro an elite force. 
Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth Is an example of a game that has hero units but they are all controlled by one player.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrZ0VEKXCUMThis Idea came from watching competitive games of Age of Empires, and seeing people micro the military units. There's only so much time to react and make micromovements, and most of their time has to be spent managing the larger economy and moving large masses of military units.The LotR:BfME game has hero units like Gandalf etc and you can level them up and if they die you can get them again after a short timer countdown.  Basically I would like to see one player play as the hero unit, more like a MOBA almost, but they can  defend the other team member as they play the classic rts and also do raids  on the other player.  The hero unit could either earn a small force of units to control, or maybe be given some by the other players.The last player is the Military General which would control many normal military units, usually several hundred.  It could be cool to have these people not share line of sight, or not in real time. I think especially for the hero unit. They could communicate, and see what areas have been explored.
 
A civilization game where the skill tree is random 
I really like Sid Meier's Civilization games, but I don't like how the static skill tree dictates unit/economic progression. With a decent knowledge of history, a player can guess that mathematics is going to lead to artillery at some point. I am proposing a game where the social and military advancements are known, but the research path to arrive at them has been randomized at game start, thus forcing players to explore various dead end paths before unlocking advancements. For example there could be three research trees Social, Economic, Military, and four research disciplines Nature, Literature,  Astronomy, Math. As ruler you can tell your Social college to study Literature, your Economic college to Study Nature, and your Military college to study Astronomy. Several turns later your Social college says there are no further advancements it can make in Literature and they are going to start looking into Math. Your economic college on the other hand some how figured out the production line by studying Nature and your military college was inspired to invent the machine gun by studying Astronomy.You can send spies to enemy civilizations further along the tech tree than you and steal their discoveries or steal the correct path to those discoveries. For example your civilization could be significantly behind in economics but you send a spy to a neighbor that is further ahead and find the research path for the next two advancements are Nature and Math thus saving you from having to guess Nature and Math from the 3 other choices.Also the effects of some advancements could be randomized to change the optimal strategy per session. One session unlocking agriculture could result in a +3 economic boost and unlocking archery gives a +1 military boost, and another game could have agriculture+1 and archery +3, thus changing the ease of an economic vs military victory at each session.
 
Flash is dying at the end of this year. Someone should probably make a compilation of the best flash games we grew up with. 
 
Story-driven FPS game with a WW1 theme. 
You play as a regular soldier of the Czechoslovak Legion. You will experience the frustration of a soldier who is fighting against his brothers(Austria-Hungary) to fulfill the ultimate goad - founding Czechoslovakia. The story is divided into chapters. Once you will be fighting in a big battle like Zborov and next time you will be persuading your brothers from Austria-Hungary to join you. You will experience several strong moments like hanging one of your friends for treason when Hungarian soldiers found him.Gameplay will try to balance arcade and realism. You won't be able to run wherever you want, you will need to think and not rush enemies like Rambo. On the other side, guns won't be as hard to handle as irl.
 
My Pet Planet" , a virtual pet game, where the pets are planets. 
Functions like a virtual pet idle game, which progresses without you.Foster _cold dead rocks_ into flourishing and thriving eco systems..Thats it..
 
A survival game without any dialogue where the emotion is conveyed through background Classical music only 
A survival / exploration game where there is only 1 player the narrative is told entirely without dialogue and only with pieces of Classical music to express emotion. Beethoven's Moonlight sonata, Pachebel's Canon in D, 1812 Overture, etc. Will feel kind of like watching an old animated movie picture without audio
 
Dynamic AI 
Let's say that the game consist of a small town and in that town are NPCs. In a regular game they are nameless, have a few voice lines and really don't do much apart from either run away or fight you. My idea would be all NPCs would be given names, jobs and essentially have a proper life. The NPCs would have a web of relationships such as family members, friends, etc. They will have their own set property and live in that property like a normal person. Also unlike in games like RDR2 where killing an NPC simply puts a bounty on your head and decreases your rep slightly. Instead of just despawning and being forgotten about, if the body is found there would be a funeral and people who are close to that person would attend. There would be also a chance of the family launching a vendetta, forming mobs, attacking on sight or generally being pretty vicious to you if you come near them. It would add a lot of depth to games instead of just mindlessly shooting NPCs you would have to think about your consequences and the morality of killing someone, something games seem to have a difficulty in achieving. Another thing would be that your actions would have an impact on this town. Injure the shopkeeper? The store will remain closed for several in game days or weeks until they return. Kill the bar owner? The bar could close permanently if they have no designated successor or if their heir chooses to sell the bar. In a similar token if you give $10000 for a homeless person you could see them later with a job and a house. In short whatever you do, positive or negative could affect the gameplay and how in this case the town would change.Though such a concept would be time-consuming and costly as well as increasingly the power needed to run the game slightly, I feel like games would be a lot more deep and the NPCs more than a moving cardboard cutout of a person. Games like The Sims, The Guild and CK2 and 3 all have various elements of this concept but implanting them in open world action games like GTA or Red Dead would make a much more immersive and interesting experience.
 
Hostage Negotiation 
I'm imagining a game with thousands of dialogue options and choices. The dialogue would be text based though, so this should still be doable for someone dedicated to it.I'm imagining an art style and dialogue system similar to Gunpoint.Do you send in a SWAT team? Do you satisfy a demand for food? Do you set up snipers? Can you convince the criminals to let some of the hostages go?You have finite resources at your disposal, X hostages to rescue, and Y criminals to arrest or kill. Arresting awards more points than killing. Take too long, deny too many demands, or otherwise freak out the criminals, and hostages may die... or the criminal may not have the guts to do it (the player has to figure that out).There could be significant variability in each hostage situation, aside from the number of hostages and criminals. How armed are the criminals? Do they have an explosive? Is there anyone on the inside who you could reach and make into an inside-man? Does the local area offer good sniper posts? Are there multiple entrances to the building?Unexpected variables may also crop up. Weather conditions, hostages having medical emergencies, hostages trying to "be the hero", etc.If you want to go the extra mile, there could also be a reputation and upgrade system. The outcomes of previous hostage negotiations will open extra dialogue options, and color how the criminals react to you (they may be nervous, cocky, or downright afraid of you). Upgrades could include gaining access to more utilities for hostage negotiations, as well as putting your character through special training to open up new dialogue options (e.g. if your character has an education in psychology, they may be able to better reason with the criminals).---Edit: If you develop this, I only have four requests:1. That it's available on PC (ideally on Steam).2. That I'm given some small nod within the game (it can be a blatant "Thanks", my username as graffiti somewhere, whatever.3. A free copy of the game4. I'd also appreciate periodic updates on how development is going, just to satisfy my curiosityYou don't have to do any of these, but I'd appreciate it.---To anyone interested in working on this, a group has formed here: https://discord.gg/H6nfMws
 
I'm working on a project to make a movie as interactive as possible like a game! 
The entire game is streamed online based on your choices and works as a streaming service for interactive movies! I just released a short demo for this purpose too (link- [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.Holly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.Holly)). Need reviews, collabs and tips :)Since the subreddit doesn't allow for images, I'm posting the link to our insta handle if you're interested- [https://www.instagram.com/\_project\_holly/](https://www.instagram.com/_project_holly/)
 
41 Days 
A game where you are an office worker and for some reason you get stuck in the office and can't get out. There is a crane building new, procedurally generated floors every night and they get worse and worse in safety each time (either having holes, bad supports, etc.). You have 41 days before the entire building collapses under the weight.You'd have different bars for Sanity, and maybe Thirst/Hunger. They drop as your mental state deteriorates. In addition, there's be a voice in your head, which gives you useful information on what to do at the start of the game, but as your sanity bar drops, it starts giving misleading or bad advice, and so it's up to you whether you trust it or not.Not completely sure about the rest as it was an idea from my brother that he never made, but hey, why not post it here to stop it going stale.Also, I'm not sure which flair to put on this, so I'm not going to put any.
 
A Satisfying Green Lantern Game - The Lantern Experience 
So I've been thinking about how a Green Lantern game could work and I think I've got something worth sharing.Imagine a Green Lantern game where every button and combination do something different. Light attacks, continuous attacks, AOE attacks, shields, constriction attacks and so on. None of these attacks have any default look. Instead, they'll be constructs created by the developers and the community.The players would be connected to a shared multiplayer (kind of like Death Stranding) where they will share a database of constructs created by users. That way, whenever the player uses an attack or a move, the appearance would change. I'm thinking the game should have a Construct Workshop where players create a construct and link it to one of the buttons or attack types. I'm imagining a tool that's simple to use with a lot of depth. You could have people create all sorts of constructs ranging from simple objects to full on Kaiju or freighters or robots. The possibilities would be quite literally endless.I also imagine there should be some sort of immediate like/dislike button so that players can avoid certain people's creations or creations they deem... strange or have more creations from talented people. Undoubtedly, there would be a lot of immature stuff.It would also allow people to create constructs without having to do anything prior and they could even become excited about what their next attack will look like. After a few hours of playing and telling the game what types of constructs they like, they would start getting constructs that suit their tastes.There's just something about having a game about Green Lanterns which would use the community's creativity to grow.
 
A Terminator video game where you play as one of Skynet's Terminators. 
There are several modes to this game, which on their own are sort of similar to existing games, but together is quite original.The main story mode: you are a T-800 sent back to eliminate some key Resistance figures. In each level you have a different target whom you must kill to progress. About halfway through, you have a mission to kill the faction leader, but they reprogram you. Now you are on the other side, and you must destroy other Terminators sent to finish the job you failed.Time trial mode: You are in a busy street and have a number of targets. When you get the first target, they will remain until terminated, at which point the next target appears. This continues until all are terminated, and achievements are granted based on how quick you are.Multiplayer versus: 4 players, either split screen or online, and there are 4 characters to choose: T-800 (Arnie), T-1000 (Judgement Day), TX (T3) or Rev-9 (Dark Fate). This is a simple versus mode with respawns; first player to however many points wins, and points are granted by terminating opponents.
 
Weird permadeath idea I had. 
Third person shooter game where your limbs get shot off and you pick others limbs off the ground to heal yourself. Design would be cartoonish, almost like fortnite but also like The Simpsons. Gameplay would be akin to call of duty: AW.
 
A Black Panther game with PS4 Spider-Man mechanics 
I was recently playing the 2018 spider-man game on PS4 and forgot about how good the mechanics are. The nature of spider-man’s fighting style just makes it that much more believable for the player. So I thought, what if there was a Black Panther game with the same mechanics? Minus the web slinging of course xD
 
A sandbox game with completely foreign physics. Objects get lighter when wet. An object's momentum is dependent on how hot it is. Gravity is object-dependent rather than world-dependent. Nothing makes sense... and yet with player experimentation it can. 
This is a game about exploration. But instead of exploring a world or its history like Breath of the Wild or Outer Wilds, the thing you are exploring is new physics itself. The game world behaves unlike anything we're used to... and it's all unnamed, uncategorized, undocumented and unestablished.The promise is that the player could get the feeling Isaac Newton had when he realized the actual nature of gravity.
 
A relaxing city builder where instead of building sprawling cityscapes of skyscrapers and districts, you focus on growing a small suburban town. 
This just came to me, and I'm surprised I've never personally seen anything like it before. Imagine City: Skylines, but scaled waaaay down. You're not building a city, your building a small, middle America town with good, simple people. There would of course be your usual city builder elements, road construction, planning, deciding on laws based on what's going on in the town, and so on. However, I think the unique gimmick would come from a focus on individual characters. Every character would come with a simple backstory, a set of stats, and relationships to other characters. Think CK3 characters, but once again scaled way down. Less feudal, more neighborly.You would assign characters to certain roles within the city, like sheriff, and watch them live their lives. In terms of minute to minute goals, i'm imagining a sort of random event type of mechanic. You might be faced with a big company wanting to buy out a whole neighborhood to build a megamall, and you, as town leader, would make choices that affect how those events play out. Different characters would have different opinions on each event and your choices would lead to new developments in their lives. Additionally, each character would have random events happen to them individually, though the player would only be notified if these when it directly impacted a characters ability to fulfill their role within the town. Through each character's page you'd be able to see a break down of their entire story so far. In short, the game would take aspects from both city builders and the CK games and scale them down to simpler variations. The point would not be to grow or conquer, but rather to experience the history and story of your town as it plays out. All of this would be set to a lo-fi score and minimal graphical design to make the world pop and breath for a relaxing, story telling experience.
 
How to make permadeath less disheartening? 
I'm working on a multiplayer "roguelite" game and I want permadeath to be one of the primary mechanics. Something about risk and reward is very interesting to me and I think a lot of people (players of Rust and it's risks, any roguelike, Eve to some extent) but I fear that if I make it too discouraging it will drive players away.The game as it stands will have you controlling a party of adventurers like Darkest Dungeon or Final Fantasy, for context. But for discussions sake, if you have any ideas for lone adventurer battle systems, lmkAny thoughts on how I can make it less demotivating to die? Thoughts for now:- have progression tied mostly to items, but have passive abilities that stick through runs. All party members lose their items on death. Problem with this I think is how player trading can be used to boost newbies by giving away op items? Might not be as big an issue as I make it out to be since skills can be required to use high level stuff- have a random party member sacrificed when the party gets knocked out. They are lost for good. Characters become dispensable and tradable¿ but all other characters keep items/skill progression. Probably my favourite out of these, but I'm easily swayed. - everyone dies, start over on death  Probably the most brutal but maybe I can make it more rewarding by making it optional and give faster progression? Hardcore mode for those replaying, but still leaves the question of what to do for normal mode- progression focuses purely on skills, lose all or most skills on death. So your party keeps their items but becomes loses all proficiency, but rare items aren't as much of the grind as running dungeons or quests (or however you upgrade gear)- have items locked behind a wall of some kind. Player has to do X to get progression back? Least favourite since players can easily rage quit and not be motivated to get through the wall - maybe have death be a common occurrence, and initially not brutal until you want to shoot for endgame?- have death affect players reputation and how they interact with NPC's so that death is still brutal, but the player doesn't get weaker as suchAny ideas or criticisms are greatly appreciated :)
 
What are some things or ways you would improve the Hack and Slash Genre? 
Like what are some new things you would like to see in the genre or what are some ways you would improve it that hasn’t been done in a game yet
 
Supermarket Battle Royale game. You're dropped in a store with nothing in your basket and have to search for food & fight other people. Toilet paper is a legendary loot. Some boxes contain coronavirus. 
Let's go.
 
A body horror game where the player slowly turns into a hideous monster as the game progresses 
It would be a first-person survival game where the final objective is to find the antidote to your condition. The only way you would be able to check how you currently look like is through mirrors positioned around the map.
 
A while back I had an idea for a Mega Man style game where every boss is from the Periodic Table. 
I think I first had this idea in Chemistry class a few years ago, but I thought the periodic table of elements was kind of neat, and I often thought about what weapon or level gimmicks you could base off of them:**Helium:**Helium is most commonly used to make things float, so the level would take place on an airship with a flying boss. Beating them would give you some sort of temporary flight item.**Iron:**Iron’s level would be a medieval fortress, with loads of spikes and armoured guards, ending with a fight against a knight wielding tons of sharp weapons. Defeating them would grant you a sword for melee, that could also block projectiles.**Neon:** Basically Bright Man from Mega Man 4 if you’ve played that. A stage themed around changing light levels, and a boss with lasers and flash weapons. He’d give you some sort of light based weapon.**Lead:**A military base or something would be a fitting level for this one, and as for the /weapon?Guns. Just guns. Lots of big heavy duty guns. Maybe a machine gun that ricochets off walls or something.**Phosphorus:**Phosphorus will burst into flames upon contact with oxygen, so this would be a run of the mill fire level. Phosphorus would probably utilize fiery grenades in the boss fight, and that would be the weapon you get from them. P.S: My runner up for “fire boss” was sulphur aka Brimstone, so you could just use that instead.**Nitrogen:**Liquid nitrogen is extremely cold, making this the Ice level. Maybe a submarine or boat of some kind frozen in the water? Something like that. Nitrogen’s weapon would be a generic freeze ray, enough said.**Copper:**Copper is very conductive, and used in most wiring. Its also used in electro magnets, which could be a good mechanic. Beating them could give you some sort of super magnet weapon or something.**Gold:**The level would be a mine/quarry of some kind, maybe with a river through it (like panning for gold). Not sure about the boss or weapon though, maybe something related to Midas?**Uranium:**A power plant/toxic waste dump. Rivers of radioactive waste, possibly mutated enemies, and defeating the boss would give you an X ray cannon or something.These are just the handful that I thought were the strongest, and I may expand upon a few of them in the future.
 
Enemies build the level as you play it. 
For context: 2D Stealth Action Game.Every level starts pretty much empty apart from the main outside walls and the staircase to the next level. But the construction workers are already doing their thing. Walls that will block your path, doors that require keys, spike traps, cameras that will record you, lasers that will fry you and explosive barrels that will be placed in inconvinient places. You gotta take them out as they carry these items to their destination.Now, does this sound fun? Should I add something to improve it?EDIT: To prevent frustration, the places where the builders can place their stuff would probably be transparent and show what can be placed there. Or maybe there should be a line indicating where they wanna go.
 
City building games with moving cities 
I like city building games but I often get disappointed by the lack of danger, the lack of frustrating events happening. In games that actually throw bad stuff at you, it's usually natural disasters, random bad things (power surge, meteorite, stuff like that) or people attacking your settlement.What if it was more than that, what if entire cities were attacking you ?It would be a mix between mortal engines and the myth of baba yaga. Basically, a big magical cataclysm wiped out the world and the survivors managed to learn and use magic. With that, they created cities with legs and other contraptions, merging industrial devices and magical functionalities.You then have a basic building game but your city can move and you have to go where resources are to survive and expend your city.In addition to natural disasters, random bad things and the occasional big magical monster (dragons ?) attacking you, there would be cities that fancy the same resources as you, which would lead your city into technological and magical wars with other cities.You would be able to develop both your magical abilities and technological skills to increase the movement speed of your city's legs, your spells' strength for combat, or instead increase your production and the efficiency or your weapons.As for in-city events, there would be the usual things like people having a bad mood, but some things like discrimination against magic users could happen if your city is not balanced between magic users/magical beings and classic humans.I think the hardest part would probably be the dev as city building games probably require a lot of stuff to code in general. Graphics could be simply low poly 3D stuff with a minimum of animations or big AAA stuff ofc.
 
Shadow of the Colossus, but instead of killing huge creatures, you heal them. You climb up on an almost dead colossus to reach a spot where you can insert healing magic and the further along you are with healing, the harder it gets to stay on because the thing is moving again. 
I just wish there were more AAA games that didn't have combat as a main mechanic, and this just came to mind. 
 
A game where you collect liquid and become a bigger blob 
Just saw this post (linked below) and i thought it would be cool if there was a game where you collected liquid on a surface or something like this.    https://old.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/m86ckd/a_big_drop_collecting_smaller_drops/  kinda like katamari damacy meets the labrinth tilt marble game meets agar.io  maybe there's bad liquid you avoid (themed as poison or something) and also like surface tension/physics come into play, like you're not always a blob, you kinda stick to some surfaces and your shape gets distorted. sounds like a fun project working on liquid physics a lot.anyway. i just literally thought of it while watching that video so maybe its not great. lmk if this exists or what anyone thinks.
 
A multiplayer party game where the only way to kill monsters is to open airlocks of certain rooms on a spaceship, creating a vacuum, at times with your friends still inside. 
* Oxygen can be a core mechanic. Similar to how FTL does it, rooms take a while to refill with oxygen after a complete vacuum.* The spaceship could be a randomly generated set of rooms that players try to utilize best for killing monsters and having a safe place to retreat to.* For maximum drama have the doors open and close really slowly. So when a friend doesn't quite make it, we get to hear their anger/fear.
 
[B~I] A fighting game where you control both characters 
I was watching Game Grumps play Brief Karate Foolish again and got a weird game idea...A fighter where you play both characters.If you move, they move.  Trying to close distance on them means they are walking away and vice-versa.  Any attack would result in a draw as you punch/kick each other in exactly the same waySo, how do you make progress?IDK, it's just a throwaway.  Perhaps different characters have different moves, ranges and such so that each match is a sort of 'puzzle' where you have to figure out how to land a hit without getting hit in return... kinda like Divekick
 
Pick Your Poison 
Essentially, this is a Dark Souls type game where you are extremely weak - You do little damage with your attacks and just a few attacks from the enemies will kill you - but you have tons of poisons at your disposal. So, every fight consists of you deciding which poisons to use, poisoning the enemies through various means, and then dodging and blocking all their attacks until they die from the poison - while also re-poisoning them when the poison effects wear off.You would have to make the poisons yourself by collecting the ingredients and then doing a small mini game to make the poisons. You would also need to acquire the blades, arrows, and bombs that you would apply the poisons to, by either making them yourself or buying them.There would a strategy element to picking your poisons. Weaker poisons could be made much easier, while you’d have to go out of your way to acquire ingredients for more powerful poisons. Different poisons could have different trade-offs, like a poison that does less damage per second but slows down the enemies’ attacks. Poisons also come in different colors, with poisons of different colors being able to stack on top of each other. It’s also possible for you to be poisoned yourself by enemies or your own bombs, so you need to have the proper equipment and some antidotes ready if you want to be safe.The story is pretty simple. There’s some great evil that’s going to destroy everything and you are one of the heroes that has set off to save the world. You were relentlessly mocked for specializing in poisons, with people pointing out how ineffective poisons are against monsters and how dependent poison specialists are on the rest of the party, but you doubled down and decided not only to save the world using your poisons but to do it completely alone.
 
Planet with radioactive overgrowth 
A survival/adventure game that takes place on a radioactive planet that starts off with little to no plants or animals. As each day passes the plants and animals mutate and grow larger. At first there is no danger for the player but eventually the animals and plants would grow large enough that they could eat the player (dinosaurs and venus fly traps).So starting off you'll want to collect precious resources while you can before the planet gets dangerous. By the time the creatures and enemies have mutated enough to become dangerous, the player should ideally have an inventory of items to fight them off.I'm still figuring out what the goal of the game would be, but I'm thinking the player has to make it to the center of the world to kill off the final boss (some radio active beast) and then the overgrowth would die off and thus beating the game. To make each play through different, the world would have to be procedurally generated, such that the way to get to the center of the planet is different for each play through.
 
A game where you die when your health is exactly 0. If your health is negative, you become a zombie or something and things that normally heal a player bring your health closer to 0.

Cold War Spy Game 
A third or first person Stealth-Action game set in Europe during the Cold War.  Missions and events appear and disappear at specific points in the game like in dead rising 2, forcing the player to juggle tasks under time pressure.Game world;* Consists of a series of hubs representing major European cities on both sides of the Iron curtain. * Similar in feel to levels from the recent HITMAN games but larger and not necessarily as dense in terms of hyper-contextual interactive elements.* The game takes place over a fixed period of time e.g. an in-game month and events and missions trigger at specific times and places. Mechanics;* Players inevitably acquire heat by killing people, leaving living witnesses to crimes, using weapons like bombs and sniper rifles e.t.c. in the course of gameplay. * As heat increases, players encounter more enemy agents and tighter security in the world. Heat levels are self-contained to either side of the iron-curtain and have different effects in each.* Players acquire ammo, weapons and equipment, intel on some missions and enemy agents, fake identities, disguises, urgent medical care e.t.c. from contacts that vary in each hub area. * The player is perpetually under-financed, incentivising them to under take side missions for criminal organisations and contacts to fund main missions. These create the potential to raise heat massively and add to time pressure.* Players can fail the game by dying, being captured or failing certain key main missions and will likely do so until they’ve learned the timings of in-game events, which side missions are best to undertake to gain money, which contacts provide services at the best prices e.t.c. * For experienced players, leaderboards would track player scores according to criteria like how many civilians did they kill, how much heat did they gain, how much money did they spend e.t.c. so that replay-ability could be found in min-maxing your run through the game.Story;* Depending on tone, could either play off of the stress caused by time pressure to create an intense spy-thriller feel or utilise humorous call-backs to old bond films or red-scare fears about international communist conspiracies. Maybe both.* I imagine the player being a CIA or MI6 agent for the reason that it would make sense atmospherically for the bleak, run-down Eastern bloc locations to be more dangerous for the player than Western ones that are more familiar looking to a Western audience, though this is obviously not vital to core gameplay.* A secret, score increasing hard-mode could be accessed by experienced players through a specific set of choices in main missions that could turn the player into a double-agent. Now both Eastern and Western agents are a threat and event schedules are even more demanding as the player has to complete both Western missions to maintain their cover and additional Soviet ones.
 
A farming sim set in a prison, where your sentence in an amount of food. 
First time poster. Think stardew valley mixed with the eacapest and a hint of factoreo.Set in a world where food is scarce and the prioson system is entirely automated and senctancens are based on food production. You start out with nothing, no food, no respect, no currency and a sentence of 20,000 tons of food. To make things worse there is vary little space in the yard that has not already bee claimed by another inmate. The first couple of weeks you barely have enough to feed your self. Gradually you gorw enough to trade for more land, tools and respect and what you can't barter for you take by force. Key michanis would include:-Basic farm sim stuff along with a small amount of automation-Prison gangs, rivalries and allies would fight for space, raid growing plots and shank key individuals (all of this could be done by the player as well if they managed to gain enough clout to get away with it). The player could them influence different gangs over time to strengthen or disrupt alliances.-Hunger and trading would be a big part but both revolving around the food you grow, this would mean it's a balance between feeding yourself, paying of your sentence and getting things you want for better production.-Perma death. Don't have enough food to trade with the auto doctor to heal you after a shanking, then you bleed out in the yard with your blood fertilising the plants now owned by your murderer. Your next character would then be put into the same yard a couple months later with the gangs and relationships haven't chances much and you could see the fallout of the previous characters death. Maybe it caused the management structure of the gang you were part of to collapse and now a new one has formed in the power vacuum that was left.- the yard would be constantly changing slowly to show where other inmates are with there stories, some one could have been in the infirmary for 2 weeks and come out to find all there crops stolen ect. The player can then help them or join in with the lootingAnyway I think you get the idea, might try and slowly put  it together or not idk.Any thoughts or comments?

30 random game ideas! 
Other parts:[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/55ggfy/30_random_game_ideas_4/)* 1. Make a very important speech in front of millions of people. You haven't prepared for this at all. You have to choose from a bunch of very long preset options. You have 3 seconds to choose one. Let's hope you don't say anything embarrassing or offensive.* 2. You play as a paint bucket, you must collect paint to complete paintings.* 2.1. You play as a moving paint bucket of an artist, you must collect paint in specific colors to mix them the way the artist wants them.* 3. You are on a Safari. Your car has broken down, and you must get out and find help to repair your vehicle, there is a lion/Bengal tiger quietly stalking your every move from a distance.* 4. Police are chasing the world's most wanted criminal. You are that criminal. Your only weapon and tool is a plastic spork.* 5.  You are a POS Fedex/UPS delivery driver driving a van who must drop off packages to people on time. The more damaged and destroyed they are, the higher your score.* 6. A bird is sitting on a telephone wire, who releases droppings on people underneath. The more you hit, the more birds fly in that the player can control.* 7. The walls watch what you are saying and doing.* 8. You will die in 30-60 seconds.

A game where you look through random boxes that have random things/a thing in it.* 23. You talk to your friend in a library by screaming at them at the top of your lungs. The librarians    and other people don't like this, but if you don't do this, your friend will leave you and it's game over.* 24. Sell people illnesses and diseases, by convincing them that they are really actually good or cures and vaccines. When you do eventually sell it to them, you watch the effect of what you have just given them happen in front of you.* 25. You are a blanket who eats people by wrapping around them.* 26. A goldfish is watching you watch TV. It knows the secrets of the universe and everything about you. Talk to it.* 27. Give people/your friends a randomized gift. The player has no idea what you just gave them.* 28. You have a button in front of you. Pressing it causes the world to change.* 29. You are a waiter/chef at a restaurant who wants to be fired. Serve people the wrong food. The faster you are fired, the better.* 30. Drive a car. It only has reverse and is stick shift, as well as no rear view mirrors.That's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange.
 
A Heist Game, but with more planning and less shooting. 
I was inspired by this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/gb12uc/heistrobbing\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/gb12uc/heistrobbing_game/)   I've always wanted to play a Heist game with an Ocean's 11 suave vibe to it. I know of games like Payday, and GTA but these (though I haven't played them) seem too shoot-'em-up for my taste and don't really fit within the style I'd want.  They don't come with meticulous planning, and they're much too 'crash-and-grab'.  In my head I'd think there would have to be a much bigger RPG element to it, and 3 stages with 3 different styles of game-play:1. The Original Team. You have 3 guys to start the team, which will be expanded later. I think this could be multiplayer, as you would make a character who's good at specific job, and hire other players as well, but could easily be single player too, having NPCs you can select in place of your two buddies.2. The Research Stage. This is the RPG end of the game, you need to talk to informants find all the information you can about the mark, blueprints of the building, and work out what security they have. You need to know everything, as the success, and your ability to plan depends on what you can find out. You could even try threatening and bribing to get your info. Whatever works.3. The Planning Stage, and the New Team. This, in my opinion, would be one of the best parts to the game and it's major selling point. You use your knowledge of what you gathered in the previous stage to work out a rough plan of what you're going to do, and you then need to construct a new team to fit this plan. You create what you need with a budget, and cut corners where you can. This part could be half RPG when you're recruiting and getting contacts for the plan, but also strategy style blue-print planning part. I'm not sure exactly, but there should definitely be a load of catchy nicknames for the type of characters you need, and types of plans you could pull.4. And finally, The Execution. This is where things could go wrong. Very wrong. Depending on how you did in your Planning and Research stages, the execution might not go smoothly. You need to play your part to the plan and improvise any difficulties along the way. This part I feel should act kind of like GTA perhaps, with your team checking in on an ear-piece giving updates on the rest of the plan.That's as much as I've got right now, but if anyone would actually want to build this, I'd be glad to help out with concepts for GUI game mechanics or how everything could work. I'd love to try help out.  I doubt anything like this could ever be done properly without a big business behind it, but I'd love to eventually try out the idea myself one day.
 
Zombie game, but you’re a proper zombie 
So yeah, we got some games where you’re a zombie, but you can’t infect people, you don’t get to watch a horde of fellow zombies tear through a human outpost, and in other games where you’re a zombie or have a horde of zombies, the humans just mow them down in a split-second So my idea is a zombie game, a simulator if you will, you can have a sandbox mode where you can adjust the human populace and how far/close their outposts are to each other and how well defended they are(from just being a camp with no walls and makeshift weapons to being a heavily armed outpost with tall wood walls armed with pikes and traps), you can also adjust certain things about their behavior, like will group A raid group B’s outpost(leaving a bunch of corpses for you to turn) or will group A share resources with group B(this will make things more difficult for the player) or will group A and B be neutral with each otherAs for the player, they can choose between a couple different zombie variations, I’m thinking of the current selection being crawler for stealth, tank for ravaging outposts, spitter for infecting/killing at long range whilst being frailer than glass, leaper for speed and stealth but being more easy to spot in the day time since they can’t hide wellThe player will have a couple of abilities, some class ability ideas I got are that tanks will be able to unleash an infectious cloud to turn all the humans they killed, crawlers can spit out infectious blobs that infect whoever steps on them and anyone else nearby, spitters can spit out gas that lingers for a while, turns corpses but doesn’t affect the living, and empowers any zombies in the gas, and leapers can go invisible while still able to infect people and corpsesSome “universal” abilities that are spread between all classes would be, the ability to call zombies to your area, the ability to send zombies to different locations, and the ability to move faster for a short period I’ll probably update this soon, feedback for this idea would be appreciated
 
A hardcore fantasy rpg that slowly turns into a dating sim. 
Just a funny concept for a game that I would love to see.It would first be a grotesque dungeon crawler rpg or something and slowly become more and more passive. It would turn into a completely different lovey dovey game where you date npcs or something without realizing it at first.I would definitely laugh my a** off if ever something like that were to be made.
 
Scattering extra lore in translations 
I just heard that French translation of Super Mario Galaxy reveals some extra information about Rosalina's father. These kinds of translation differences from different games pop up from time to time, and I think they are at least mostly unintentional.But what about if game makers would intentionally reveal different pieces of extra lore in different translations? The translations would seem like legit translations from the surface, but little choises of words in different translations would reveal little things about the lore. I think this could bring the gaming community all around the world together to solve the complete lore behind the game.And just to be clear: The overall gameplay would not revolve around this and the players wouldn't be informed about this in any way. It would be something that some players interested about the deeper lore could find out by themselves.
 
Dating simulator where you must win the affection of the local girls in your neighborhood. The twist.. you play as a dog. 
Go around the local block, cul-de-sac, or wherever, looking for potential buddies or mates. A bit like those japanese dating simulators, except you are a dog looking for bitches.
 
A game where you solve a murder by dying and restarting 
Similar to the animes Erased and Re: Zero. This would pit a young protagonist against a serial killer. The killer's identity would he shrouded in mystery, so he'd need to investigate to find it.If the protagonist dies, he restarts the same day, fully healed but aware of his death. As he dies more, his mental state may start to shift, causing the choices he makes and the ending to change.
 
A visual novel dating sim but instead of anime girls it’s dictators and infamous national leaders 
If you made this, it would have be a bit more than just that one gimmick though. idk how you would be able to make it more interesting.
 
1v10 FPS 
 A 1v10 where the single person is team blue and has 1 minute to to place traps and explosives on their raised platform before team red (10 people) are unleashed. Team blue has unlimited ammo and 3 lives while team red has 1 life each and limited ammo. Depending on how good you did you will get a certain amount of coins that you can use to get better traps/explosives/guns/and more ammo.
 
A battle Royale but.... 
(My english is realy horrible so I hope you can still get my idea)If you kill someone, he can manipulate the environment around you. The more people you kill, the more dangerous the effects get.If you are dead and the only person who got killed by the guy who killed you can make it rain around the guy who killed you so enemies can see him better.If somebody killed five people they can make nearby trees fall down on him.I think this would be best with the mechanik from the game "death coming" from NExT Studios.It also shouldn't be in first Person and more like a top down shooter.
 
Turn-based RPG where you Lvl Down 
I had this idea for a while about a typical turn-based RPG where instead of starting from Lvl1 and having to Lvl Up to get stronger, you start from Lvl99 and lose exp and Lvl Down, becoming less powerfull. Monsters still have to be beaten to get gold, better armor and weapons and sometimes progress. The plot is that a hero killed everything, but only reached Lvl99 with 1 exp point remaining for Lvl100,his ultimate goal.He travels to another reign to find something to kill there. The first monster he sees is a slime. Even that should be enough for 1 exp point, so he attacks it. Then the slime transforms into a witch, and gives him the curse to lose exp points. She then teletrasports back into her castle. The hero must travel this new, foreign land and find the witch, and defeat her to remove the curse and reach Lvl100!So he must have good armor and good weapons and items, but also have a good level. You will need to be picky on the monsters you choose to kill, because you'll need a balance to defeat the witch! Do you think this could work? What do you think of the idea? 
 
A horror game about the Karen's coming to attack you the manager. 
Ok so hear me out. Your the Manger of a store, your goal is to get through day. You do day to day things like, stocking items, checking customers, answering calls.  But then Karen comes in, she has the typical "can I speak to your manger" hair cut. You know your infor a long day. You know if you mess up, even a little she's gonna report you. And maybe take your kids. So basically it's a resource management game but with a horror twist.Edit: Typos
 
I hate that the protagonist is always fearsome 
I am thinking of making a game , in a Rougelite genre where the protagonist is coward but he is forced to build up his courage to live.. but the buildup is gradually. so he, at the beginning is only able to kill critters and run away uncontrollably from beasts and men ( player lose control ).I really need your input in such concept, i dont believe something similar was created before.
 
A dungeon looter or survival game in which the only way to beat the game is to sacrifice all your resources for a final one-way trip. 
In the 1997 movie Gattaca, two brothers would always compete on the beach to see who could swim out furthest from shore, and the *weakest* of the two brothers won every time. The stronger brother, despite having more stamina, invariably turned back first knowing he needed to save some energy for the swim back. He asked his brother how he always won, and the brother admitted his secret was that he never planned on coming back.### We can apply this theme to a survival game:Picture a survival game in which the player is stranded in the middle of nowhere. He can travel from his campsite to gather resources, but he always has to take enough supplies to survive the journey back to camp. He gets better stuff, improves his production and even finds a helpful cargo mule that lets him travel further than ever, but the player never finds rescue.To the East is a desert he doesn't travel because it doesn't have resources. At night there are lights on the horizon beyond the desert. The player has tried to cross the desert but has always had to turn back.At some point the player has to make a decision that will let him cross the desert. He has to completely tear down his campsite to get the raw materials he'll need for the journey, load up his faithful mule and leave nothing behind. Deep into the desert, food and water will get scarce and the player will have to decide to let his mule die in order to have enough for himself. Yoshi sacrifice. It's the player's [Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaQa4ttIyNo) moment. It'll be the only way to cross the desert.### This also works for a rougelike dungeon looter:A dungeon looter in which the player reaches lower floors for better gear (which will let him go even deeper on the next run) but he'll lose everything he collected if he doesn't survive the journey backl. Like Darkest Dungeon, the player is trained to start a run with empty inventory slots to have enough space for loot. Collected loot will be unusable until it's refined/repaired at base camp, so you can't use gear on the run you collected it.Eventually the player will plateau, and reaching lower floors to face the final boss will seem impossible... unless the player decides to ignore loot. They'd have to fill their inventory to the brim, ignore the most tempting loot ever, and use up their supplies without saving any for a journey back. It's the only way to reach the final boss, and it would be amazing to see a player suddenly realize this.
 
You play on a GameBoy in the back of a car, while things happen in background. 
I don't know if this has been done, but I'm thinking about a game where you play videogames on a handheld device, but the whole point of the game is things that happen around you while you play, like dialogues of other people and such.   I guess this doesn't make a full game, but more like an "interactive experience" as they call short film-like games. Also, if the player can affect the outside world or is just an inattentive observer diverges into completely different games, it would be cool if what you did in the videogames affected the things that would happen in the "real" world.
 
I need some simple ideas for a game for a beginner! 
I'm a beginner with unity, I've made some games before with it but nothing really good or polished or, fun really lol. If anyone has some relatively simple or small scale ideas to share with me, I'd super appreciate it!
 
A beat em up where you use a guitar as a weapon and play chords to summon creatures and perform combos 
This is a dream of mine. I feel music should be more intertwined to non rhythm games in general.
 
I had this Horror game idea and I have to tell someone 
Maybe someone already thought about this idea but this is how it goes.Basically you know how most horror games are in complete darkness and scary ambient sounds and things cracking squecking etc.Well I tought about a horror game simply called "Hidden in plain sight". Watch this, its a bright sunny day birds a chriping sun is shining the grass is green everything is nice.You fell relaxed and safe. But the creature that is trying to get you is simply hidden in plain sight. You can spot it if you look good enough but it is so well hidden in the surounding and its just easing closer and closer.Now I would love to have people aswell and you walk trough them and maybe someone like behind you creapily goes 'Psst hey' and you turn around and its just a normal person like asking you for directions but maybe the next time it is not. The creature is extremly good at blending in.I dont know the objective, I have not tought about it thoroughly only the broad concept. Also I would not like a bullshit aproach to killing it like if you see it you can pop a 45. In his skull and the game is finished no collecting magic stone from my grandmother that she hid in her ass.English is not first language sry
 
Doubt about video game development 
Hello, I am new to the page and I would like to ask you about video game development. I apologize first of all for the fact that English is not my mother tongue.&#x200B;I am currently working on a horror game and once I finish it I would like to continue with a somewhat simple FPS, set in the Second World War similar to the first COD, MOH or BF. And what I really want in the future is to create a City Builder, I imagine how complicated it must be, but that's why I'm going little by little.&#x200B;I am using UE4 and Blender among other programs. The horror video game is still a prototype and for now I am concentrating on the story, mechanics that it must have and the Script Holes that I am finding, perhaps later when I have something finished I will share it with the community.&#x200B;My biggest question is the following, to create (in the future) a City Builder style game, what should I learn? I do not think I use something as complex as destruction of land and I do not pretend that it is a AAA game, but at least something nice and that people can have fun for a while. Many times in my head when I am thinking about my horror game ideas come to mind of how it should be, for that reason I would like someone to give me a hand.&#x200B;I am not asking for a complete tutorial on how to make a City Builder, I am satisfied with the basics that one should know in order to be able to make the odd prototype in the future, I saw a channel on YouTube, but I understand that the creator abandoned it. From already thank you very much.
 
A racing game through gauntlet obstacle courses where the goal isn't on getting first, but rather getting FURTHEST. 
The starting line is *packed* with racers. As each player is eliminated by falling off a cliff, getting smashed to bits by giant wrecking balls, blown up by a landmine or whatnot, they are immediately kicked out of the lobby to start another race elsewhere. Meanwhile, the dwindling survivors start seeing a hint of hope of winning.But there can only be one.If you were the furthest racer along the course when you were eliminated, you stay in the lobby in hopes nobody reaches your distance. Perhaps you only spectate or maybe you get to control something to mess with the remaining survivors.To prevent players from trying to play at a snail's pace, the physics and handling would reward high speed. The faster you go, the more nimble your vehicle handles. The normal turn radius of the vehicles is *abysmal*, so players must rely driving fast enough to powerslide.****Aesthetically, the game could be anything from a surrealist take on destruction derby, to a futuristic Wipeout/F-Zero death sport. However, the simpler the graphics, the more racers could theoretically fit in to a single course.
 
A cute, calming, creative game where you live in space! 
Imagine a game like Animal Crossing, The Sims 4, Minecraft, and Little Big Planet combined, making a completely custom world/avatar game for creative people, and you live in space. Features of the game would include building anything you dream of, Creating cute avatars with the best character creator, design your own clothes that you can wear or share to your friends, starting a farm for foods and flowers, and more. I'll go into more into more detail for each feature, I have a lot of ideas.Building- You can choose where you want to build, weather is on a cute pink planet with neon water, or a dark Purple cloud in the middle of space. Building blocks would be able to have different textures that you can change the color of. There would be a Snap Grid so every block fits into place, which you can toggle on or off. Premade items like fences, and chairs will be available, but if you wanted, you can make your own, and save them/ upload them to a gallery where others can use them.Avatar Creator- you can make your avatar extremely unique with tons of presets and sliders. For hair, There would be presets you can use, or you can make your own hair with individual parts for the front, sides, and back. Patterns like gradients, streaks, spilt color and more can be applied to any hair preset or part. Any hair that you've made can be saved and posted to a online gallery. For the body, You'll have the ability to change anything you want, Height, weight, don't want legs? have a mermaid tail! want more animal like features? Have ears and a tail! Wanna create a weird cat- mermaid species? Anything would be possible.(save and load body/species presets to the gallery).Clothing design- Have you ever had a piece of clothing that you loved but you wanted it to be longer, or have puffy sleeves? No problem! in this game you can create your own Custom clothes with tons of parts! Sliders for length, tightness, and more will make sure you can create anything you want. Mirroring and be toggled off for more abstract pieces. Chains, belts, buttons, spike, feathers and more can be placed anywhere. Textures, colors and patterns can all be applied to any part of the clothing.  I'm pretty sure you've guessed it by now, but whatever you make can be saved, and posted to an online gallery.Farming- you live in space, so you need to farm your own resources! Fruits, vegetables, grains, flowers, and more can be planted! Discover new plants by mutating or breeding others together. Flowers look pretty, but would also have a important use! once you discover a new flower. you'll have an idea for a pattern! the pattern can be used for clothes and building blocks, Dyes can all be made!I've always dreamed of a game like this, I've gotten by with The Sims and Minecraft, but my creative side has been longing for a game where you can do what ever you want to. I would love to hear feedback, and ideas on what other features can be in the game. sorry for making this so long. If you made it this far, i hope you have a great day! :) 
 
Desolated Isolation (Game Idea) 
An RPG game, set in a open world, where you are the last remaining human in existence. There are only animals, plants, and the constructs left behind by humanity's disappearance.There is a time-span to world destruction. Nuclear power-plants and the like have been left to its own devices and are bound to self-destruct. And if averted, you still have to survive. Death is game-over, you go into the game with a set amount of experience, skills and knowledge. You can also gain skills, experience, and knowledge. But if you don't keep up with your memory, everything will fall apart. Hence, the sanity meter. It'll keep track of your mind-frame. At the end of the game, is statistical analysis of your choices, which the sanity meter keeps track of. Which is from the frame to true happiness, to swift madness. To lean more toward one side than the other, is death. Game-over. The goal of the game, is to see how long you can survive, doing whatever it is you can to keep self intact. You receive the ability to attribute values to objects in the open world, or subjects upon meditation. Experience increases skill. The upward momentum of the sanity meter, will keep your memory intact. Lean too far into the positive side of the sanity meter though. Game-over. But you also have to look out for physical safety. Cooking fresh meat produces health, too much of it increases weight. Likewise all manner of foods, or even the lack thereof, changes your overall survivability percentile. Purity of water matters as well. Every attribute you give to an object, dependent on its relation to other objects, will either increase or decrease the probability of finding it. This game teaches, practical moralities and philosophies. And thus, asks the question overall: How would you fair in a world if the rest of humanity disappeared?
 
An FPS, but you are the worlds best thrower 
Your player has absolutely 0 gun experience, but you know how to throw ANYTHING to make dmg
 
This Sub Should be Better 
This is a great subreddit. I doubt I have any more saved posts than ones that come from here. Several of the ideas I’ve found here became some of my first game prototypes and I’m grateful to have found this community and explore the sharing of game ideas.That said, there is a constant plague of terrible posts to this subreddit that stems from the same issue: they aren’t thought out.We’ve seen posts that say:- Should be like ‘insertgamehere’...” then ask for carbon copies of that game- Posts that have no actual way to be made into a game without a time machine- One sentence posts that give no information- Posts that are too poorly-worded to understandThe best posts on this subreddit are formatted with subheadings. They will include headers like: STORY, GAMEPLAY, VISUALS and speak a little on each element. I wouldn’t mind if each idea had to have at least these three basic parts thought out before getting posted here.Look, I get it. This is people sharing ideas freely and that means some will be bad. Some of the best ideas here have been one sentence long. But it’s easy to see that a large portion of those terrible ideas could be chafed out by requiring a bare minimum of thought entered into the idea. I WANT to make a person’s idea. I don’t want to read the twentieth post asking for “Call of Duty but with fully collapsible environment, VR compatibility, and nothing else.”Tell me I’m screaming at clouds, I don’t care. I’ll still love this sub tomorrow and my next game will probably come from here. This is just my thoughts and I want to know what others think.
 
Post Apocalyptic zombie game, but the focus is on cleaning/rebuilding your destroyed city. The more you get rid of garbage/overgrowth/bodies, the less zombies will spawn 
 
A top-down runner game where you play as a single pixel that grows by collecting other pixels 
Pixels are spread all over the track, and each one you collect makes you one pixel larger (similar to the ball in Katamari Damacy). Becoming larger means you can plow through smaller obstacles, while if you hit an obstacle larger than you, pixels will fly off. Checkpoint flags require that you have a certain amount of pixels accumulated to progress. At the end of each track there is some kind of object that you have to ram your square into, and the more damage you do to it, the more bonus points you get.
 
A new type of vigilante game 
I think games where you play as superheros and vigilantes are cool. But you are stuck in the same situation almost every time. Either you have something like infamous where your new to the hero/villian stuff and your character is created based on your choices. Or you have games like batman where you are a well established hero and you just follow whatever has been created for you. But what if you had full control over your character, you customize your suit and hideout, and choose whether you are a hero or villian. But you also have to make some form of commitment to your characters day life whether it be actually playing or choosing from a list of options to see what kind of job you work to see how you make the money to afford your little "hobbie" and what kind of connections you make with people. The best way I could imagine this being done is having an option to free room as your casual self to meet up with people and use your connections to benefit yourself in your hero form. If something like this exists and its not some dinky online game please let me know, otherwise I would like to hear people thoughts in this idea and possible elaboration.
 
Trying to think of ideas for a game which uses chess pieces. 
I've recently been practicing (on and off) Blender modeling and sculpting because I wanted to create my own assets for anything I'd like to make. I've had lots of practice with Unreal Engine 4 and feel comfortable that I can achieve good results with it, but I've been struggling to think of something good to make with it. I've tried to keep it realistic to make by myself, but whenever I think of an idea, I end up scrapping it a few days later because I feel it's flawed in some way. So even though I know how to make basic models and feel comfortable with UE4, I have yet to make an original creation, just a faithful recreation of Smite and its mechanics, a small street pinball game and some smaller projects.Ideally I'd like to make a turn-based 1v1 (or possibly more if there's a good idea in it) multiplayer game or a roguelike game, though I'm open to anything as long as it's fun and replayable.[Here are some examples of what my assets would look like.](https://imgur.com/a/dGtJH2u) I can do more complex models and can sculpt characters, but I want to keep things simple for myself, so I'd like to stick to chess pieces for rapid solo development.Some examples of things I've thought of but never really properly experimented with:* A vehicle fighting game, where you and your team of other players fight against a team of other vehicles, such as tanks, jeeps, helicopters, planes, boats, subs etc. Think of it like a real time Pokemon battle, but with vehicles. I actually think this would be fantastic if I could actually make it, but I was struggling to get UE4 to make it work the way I wanted it to because a lot of the design philosophy feels geared towards first/third person shooters with static cameras that follow from behind, I couldn't get both the vehicle rotation and the camera rotation to both replicate over a network without them sharing the same rotation, which really messed things up since many vehicles may not face the same direction as the camera. I didn't want to make my game feel hacky and janky, I also feel that going straight into a realtime fighting game might be a big challenge for someone going it alone.* An XCOM style game with Chess pieces, with competitiveness in mind. Basically XCOM, but with Chess pieces on an XYZ Chessboard with changes to reduce randomness (such as weapons hitting multiple times in a single attack, reducing the feast or famine nature of dice rolls). Didn't go forward with this because I felt I couldn't get turns to be short enough to make the game feel playable by two average people, though I guess it could work well for a roguelike if I knew anything about map generation.* A 1v1 Chess game on a normal chessboard, but pieces have health bars, stamina, mana, defense, abilities, passives etc. You would spawn units as the game progresses and there would be mechanics that make smaller Pawn pieces relevant alongside the more powerful Champion pieces. Each team would have a leader, instead of being checkmated, you lose when your leader is defeated. There would be things like items and leader powers, with short turn timers to keep the game flowing and rewards for taking your turns quickly, encouraging fast play like Blitz or Bullet Chess. I think this could be cool, but it's probably a very precarious balancing act and I'm still not sure it would actually be fun or just tedious. It could also be a little too different from Chess to the point that it alienates people who may be interested in playing it as an interesting Chess variant. Could also work as a roguelike, but the AI may be a huge pain.* A more tame version of the last idea, but as a roguelike. So it would be normal chess, but with random encounters and custom pieces which you can find, recruit, recycle and upgrade as you progress. Pieces would permanently die when captured and some battles may not be worth facing, so the game will largely be about resource management and picking your fights. The gameplay would probably be similar to Chess Evolved Online, except it wouldn't hurt to look at. There would still be some abilities, but they would be much less intense than the ones in my last example and be more like Hearthstone, otherwise capturing pieces and the general game flow will work the same as Chess. This is probably my favourite idea so far and also has potential for a multiplayer mode (or the roguelike aspect can be scrapped entirely for a strictly PvP game, but then I'm basically making a potentially better Chess Evolved Online) and making AI would be much more straight forward, but there's also less room for imagination and still has lots of consideration for balance.
 
Idea: A Pirate Game set in the Underworld (Hades) 
Lightly inspired by the Greek myth of Charon, the ferryman. And also by the fact that we've Never had a good PIRATE-THEMED Single player RPG (excluding Pillars of Eternity's dlc) You play as an undead Pirate, living in the underworld, with your own "Charon-boat" ship used to ferry souls into the Afterlife,atop the ever changing lake filled with monsters and mystery. Basic Gameplay loop is to look for souls, capture them into your boat and sail to the gates of the underworld. Souls can also be rescued and turned into your crewmen. Souls can be found stranded on islands, captured by other pirates or even morphed into monsters. Maybe gates to the Afterlife cab appear at different intervals in different places. Can spice up Gameplay. You can rob other boats, fight off monsters from the lake or explore the many islands that populate the Underworld. The idea is that ferrying souls grants the boat owner all their abandoned riches. Based on how they lived, each soil can add buffs/new stats to you, your ship and your crew. It can also affect the rewards given by ferrying them to the Gates of Hades. Edit: How about a time limit? "Bring X amount of souls per week or lose a lot of xp. Too much xp lost and its game over" What do you think? Any other ideas to fully flesh out this concept?
 
Game Inside a Cyberpunk Sky Scraper 
 I'm building a cyberpunk game where you can pilot drones to perform jobs. The player will own an apartment inside a skyscraper, so I want to build a mechanic for tasks specifically when the player is inside a building. It can be point and click, top down, third person, etc. I'm looking for interesting ideas that would be fun.Obviously since it's a skyscraper theres potentially 100s of rooms and of different types. I could use some procedural generation or a simple UI to interact with/add variation but I can't do anything to complex since it's just one aspect of a larger game.

RPG Classes System 
>In Character Creator menu, you can choose between:**Warrior:**  Tank/medium meelee physical damage**Archer:**  Ranged physical damage**Mage:**  Magical damage**Rogue:**  Meele physical damage**Cleric:**  Healer>Then, you have some "subclasses":**Berserker:**  Off-tank/Meelee physical damage  _(Unlocked when a Warrior learns about Nature and Monsters at the Library, a building at the cities)_ **Ranger:**  Ranged and Meelee physical damage  *(Unlocked when a Archer learns about Nature and Monster at the Library)***Pirate:**  Ranged and Meelee physical damage  *(Unlocked when a Archer learns about Rogue class at the Library)***Warlock:**  Magical damage and Debuffer  *(Unlocked when a Mage learns about Black Magic)***Druid:**  Healer/Buffer  *(Unlocked when a Cleric learns about Nature and Monsters at the Library)*__Necromancer:__  Healer/Debuffer  _(Unlocked when a Cleric learns about Black Magic at the Library)___Magical Thief:__  Meelee Magical Damage  _(Unlocked when a Rogue learns about the Mage class at the Library)___Paladin:__  Tank/Healer  _(Unlocked when a Warrior learns about White Magic at the Library and a Cleric blesses him)___Death Knight:__  Tank/Debuffer/Physical & Magical Damage  _(Unlocked when a Warrior learns about Black Magic and a Necromancer curses him)_> The requirements to become these classes look hard, but all of them can be done at the game 1st city, the only difference is that you can't create it at the Character Creation menu.
 
Game that evolves 
Yesterday, I was researching genetics, and when I went to bed, an idea came to mind...A game that evolves.... version 1.0 would be quite simple, but imagine that the website/wherever you get the game from decides to take the games code, and "mutate" it, basically change a feature/add a feature...This would surely be hard to implement, but it'd be interesting, as after some time we'd get 2 seperate games, than 3, than 4...Crappy "mutations" would probably develop glitches or just stupid features, and thats where "natural selection" comes in, these version wouldnt be played, so they'd die out!Good versions would be played and would continue to evolve.I have no idea what the story would be, or if its a sandbox, or whatever, it's just an idea my brain came up with when I was half-asleep and my brain did the "oh youre falling" thingy!Please reply with any ideas or improvements!
 
High Fantasy Action Adventure Rogue-like where 1-5 players work together to fight through as many levels as possible. 
EDIT: Meant to categorize this as an Action RPG* Rogue-like. Editing won’t allow me to change the title. **Name:** Project: Battle Tower (WIP)**Main Mechanic:** Players will battle intelligent enemies in procedural generated arenas. After defeating the enemies, players will move to the next level. After so many levels, players will reach a rest area where dead allies will be revived, health will be restored, and you can use earned gold to buy/upgrade equipment. The game ends when the entire party dies.**Side Mechanics:** · Intelligent and diverse AI. Not all enemies will overwhelm you in hoards, but rather fight you with different strategies depending on their race/class. For example, giants being hearty and strong will be very aggressive and lethal but careless and easy to hit.

9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. Years In Here, Part 1. 
You wake up with a weird machine on your neck.You try to take it off, but it says: "I HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED TO KEEP YOU HERE FOR 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. YEARS." Of course, you decide to ask where is here? The machine simply says: "HERE IS HERE." Well...that didn't help at all. You decide to take a look around. You find a giant wall made of walls, and you are let in, only to find people with the same machines around their necks. They all call this place Here, as that is the only name they were given by their machines.You are asked if you want to learn how to survive, and so you are given an optional tutorial. If you say yes, they give you a rundown on what Here is like. Creatures of all shapes and sizes, plants that wouldn't normal grow in such a tropical environment, and just a general weirdness. Nobody has anything in common with each other, and nobody knew each other before waking up in Here. They teach you how to use a weapon of your choice, and you are tasked with killing a Lesser Crawler, essentially starter enemies.You beat a Lesser Crawler, and you go back to town. You are given a book containing some crafting (and food) recipes, and you are allowed to leave at any time and do whatever you want, making this game open world. Eventually, you come by some ruins and progress the story. The ruins seem scorched and torn. You analyze the markings, which appear to be some kind of trademark sign for whatever tribe was here. The markings are nothing but an up arrow with bat wings and a halo. You look around and find some skeletons, still with the machines on them.Deeper within the ruins, you find a bunch of Lesser Crawlers and other enemies. After defeating them, You find a machine, turned off. It shows no signs of wear, and appears to be powered by a crystal. You try turning it on, and it works. It appears to work like a Time shift Stone from Skyward Sword, as it creates an aura that revives the corpses and restores the ruins in the aura. You can ask the revived corpses some questions, and they reveal that the machine isn't of their own design. As it turns out, they just found it there and used it to their advantage by keeping machines they made from wearing down.Anyway, get ready for part 2, where I'll reveal more of the story.
 
An rpg inspired by the movie Moana(idea) 
So basically the main character finds a thousand year old weapon(artifact) which can turn him into animals. And there is a chieftain who wants to take over the world using another artifact( a twin of the hero’s weapon)Gameplay: main character starts on main island with his settlement and he finds this artifact. He then explores the world (which are other islands filled with monsters and other tribes) he can then upgrade his said weapon with carvings which allow him to transform into more animals. As he continues his journey he can transfer his settlement and expand it. He uses a boat to travel to other islands or he can use his weapon to transform into a bird to travel. He could use his surroundings for stealth and can transform whenever he is fighting. The world would be alive with side quests and temples which tell the story of the heroes of old. There would also be alot of different ways to tackle your opponent. Be it chewing their head off as a bear or just plain old slicing them with your weapon. You can change midfight as wellThat’s basically the gist of it ( I just thought it would be a cool game)
 
8/16 Bit Hack & Slash where you fight through the mind of a depressed person 
 
An open world combat game where direct hits are prohibited 
I’m thinking of a game something like the Hunger Games movies, where you and a bunch of other players/cpus compete to be the last one standing, armed to the teeth with all sorts of weapons. The only catch is that you can’t use the weapons directly, but you rather have to use them to manipulate your environment. E.G. using an axe to chop down a tree and letting it fall on someone. (or a much better idea). I think an intelligent brawler would be fun.
 
tower-defense in which you collect your own building resources in the wild 
\-the starter towers would need resources collected in the wild (stones,wood,flowers,honey,etc) and as the game progresses player would need rarer resources that he would get from the waves of enemies or special tools to strengthen/upgrade/repair the towers\-later on as players upgrade towers and pass stages they would get waifu characters that function like mobile units\-player can only have a limited number of mobile units in play, but he can get those not in play to collect basic resources for him during waves only\-please try inputing a tower that has all map effect (something like bees) and the more rare support items around the tower the stronger the effectpls comment on my idea if you have any thougths like if its to complex or if i need to explain my thoughts on something&#x200B;ps. this idea is something i got from a novel on royalroad called:[Lazy Dragon Queen: Gaming in an Illogical World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27012/lazy-dragon-queen-gaming-in-an-illogical-world)

Thinking of a psych horror game for people with OCD 
A game where you play as a designer who's forced to create truly terrible graphics.The story: You're a graphic designer who must work under 9 different bosses who give you their expert opinions on how to do your job, driven nearly mad by pressure, high strung on way too much coffee, you ply your twitching appendages to photoshop, in a desperate attempt at meeting a looming deadline. You tried your best, you followed all the good and proper design principles and used your expensive education, managing to make it the least terrible you could have, but it wasn't enough. For your efforts, you're rewarded with the boot. Unhinged, indignant, misunderstood, you decide to take revenge, by embracing the darkness, the jpeg artifacts, the watermarks, the stretched texts, dad puns, and meme images, you will attempt to create true graphic abominations that will strike terror into the hearts of those who've oppressed you.
 
Many game ideas here are far too big in scope. I made a (satirical) tool to help. 
Hi! I make games.I see a lot of enthusiasm here for giant dream games -- MMO sandboxes as far as the eye can see. Those ideas unfortunately aren't useful to anyone. Why? [Your game idea is too big](http://yourgameideaistoobig.com/).Want to see your ideas upvoted and games made from them? Distill your dream game down to the smallest, simplest possible concept.
 
What can I do with a maze generator? 
I figured out how to generate random 3D mazes that a player can navigate on the inside of. I want to make some kind of a game out of this, so what could I do?What I've thought of so far involves trying to reach the end of the maze as quickly as possible while enemies (could be other players or just bots) try to stop youEDIT: Forgot to mention that I intended to make this game for smartphones (*maybe* Steam, depending on how complex it gets), so that might change the kind of gameplay people would look for. But so far, I'll probably consider a combination of most of these battle-related ideas. (

Dungeon Adviser - a reverse dungeon crawler 
**Game Pitch**\- *You are part of* ***Dungeon Advisers*** \- a little known group of individuals, whose role is to *help and advise Lords* run their dungeons. Not many know what tedious job running a dungeon really is - and you need to start from the bottom, working with lesser Lords, and gradually advancing and making a name for yourself.\- The Lords contract you to ***manage and defend their dungeons for a number of (increasingly difficult) combats***. If you succeed, you can pick and sign another Lord (think *level up*, with access to more advanced monsters, feats, spells, etc). If you lose a combat, *you get demoted a level*, as the Lords lose faith in you. ***You win when you reach level 20.*****Main gameplay loop** has two phases:\- ***building*** \- you expand the dungeon, buy, train&equip *monsters*, lay traps. Choosing between rooms or corridors offer strategic possibilities for laying traps, or adjusting the number and size of combats.*An important part of preparing would be spying on the incoming party of enemy adventurers* in order to get *bits of information* to better prepare. E.g. if the party has a rogue, the traps will probably be ineffective. Or if the party is rather cocky, they will tend to spend their resources faster, in the beginning.\- ***combat*** \- will be turn based, pretty similar to X-COM, but with a D&D-like settings and rules for the actual monsters, equipment, abilities and such. The adventurers are AI controlled (but not scripted) and actual *hits, damage&critical chances are probabilistic*. That should mean great replayability and different outcomes depending on small details.*Traps will probably be more efficient in the first battles* \- but then the monsters will not be getting very much XP. You will want XP to level-up your monsters, as this happens at a slow pace, and they will generally be a *lot weaker than the adventurers*.**Scope, team, PoC**I realize the scope is huge, especially since I am doing this on my own. Luckily, I am in no hurry to finish and get something to market, I'd rather do it properly. I have a bit of experience with gamedev, some friends which I can ask favors from, and a certain willingness to pay for a plugin, a graphics pack or music, if it easily furthers the goal.Thus being said, so far I have this proof of concept: [https://streamable.com/fnjs8](https://streamable.com/fnjs8)And this for the building phase:  [https://youtu.be/Xn1soi-yd0k](https://youtu.be/Xn1soi-yd0k) , more music for the combat is in the works.**TL;DR****X-COM** meets **Dungeons&Dragons** meets **Dungeon Lords** (boardgame)***Feedback greatly appreciated,***Thanks!
 
Dealing with creative block. Any medium game ideas (or advice)? 
Hello all! Recently I've been wanting to make a game, but I've found that every idea I come up with is either too ambitious or would take me too long to make (or both), and I know I'll lose motivation halfway through since I struggle a bit at focusing on one thing for too long. So I want to make a more realistically sized game, maybe even a minigame, but still unique. Does anybody have any game ideas for me (or even tips that might help with this)?  Thanks in advance!
 
A dating sin whodunit. You're trying to solve a string of murders in a large mansion, but the suspects are also romantic interests. 
[Edit: "Sim" not "sin". I blame autocorrect.] It's like if Agatha Christie went through a romance novel phase. You're trying to identify the murderer and hoping it doesn't turn out to be the person with whom you're getting romantically involved.
 
A game called "home sick" - basically your different items in life getting to that special place you belong called home... like a pair of socks left at a laundromat has to make it home or a piece of trash making it the dump or even a battery finding its perfect spot in a remote. 
Concept" This games mechanics are ment to be similar to the game where your bread and use the full controller and you will go on completely random missions helping an object find its way to paradise such as a battery to its remote or a lost pair of socks to its feet master or even something crazy like a butt plug to a butt hahaAs for art style I'd prefer this games art style to be like my most favorite game on earth.... "whacked!" (https://youtu.be/XbgJYHAzxhs) and be a similar game style as well as tone of game I'd like it to be random and raunchy at times and also funny and playful to and if I had my choice I'd say use the same game modes for an online game experience after you complete the campaign of matching items to its home and then you just play mini games online and all I ask is a copy of the game and it signed and have me mentioned as a major contribution to the game idea and help in developing as well if I can if not  it's ok. Examples of online play could be battery's trying to be the first to be put into the controller or even the first weave to make to the head wins or a rc lost toy finding its little boy or anything like that and then of course death matches and over sized guns lol
 
A survival game where you name everything 
I was playing Journey To The Savage Planet with a friend. It is a survival game in which you explore areas with unique wildlife while you search for a way to escape, basically. It's like Subnautica, Ark, Conan exiles, ect, basically like most survival games. This game is more focused on scanning things and learning what they are, which is why it sparked this idea, because, usually when we found a creature before we even knew its name we would already have something to call it. Sometimes it would be based on the sound it made or some silly thing that we fixated on but we would make something up. And despite finding out the names of said creature, we usually still called it the name we made up.So this got me thinking what if there was no "official" names for creatures? What if you had to put in its name, or else it will remain a nameless creature in your log. Never once should there be a hint to an actual name of the creature and instead the player should just name it whatever they think fits. I feel this would make interesting discussions with friends as well as an interesting reason to watch others playthroughs of the game. Seeing how people built up a way to communicate about these things in the game.Also what if it didn't stop at creatures? How about areas, items, mechanics, stars, abstract things, anything! It mostly would come down to the scope of the game on where it stops. But for the game to work I think it would need to have multiplayer along with a heavy focus on exploration. And most survival games usually have that, so I would think that they could be retrofitted with this idea.&#x200B;Also there are some games that seem like they have this to some extent like No Man's Sky and maybe Starbound..?(I don't remember if you can name them yourself but I believe they have random names). They seem to have it as an optional thing and on procedural creatures, making naming something kinda meaningless in my opinion. The way I think about it is that it isn't optional! It's the only way to have a name for it, a way to quickly say what you're talking about.I'm not too sure how well this would work but if a game like this came out I would love to play it! Thanks for reading! c:
 
Any old farts remember that cheesy board game from the 90's Crossfire? 
https://youtu.be/rCwn1NTK-50I think this commercial is burned somewhere in your brain if you grew up in the 90s.I had an idea for a top-down bullet hellish roguelite that's physics based.  so basically instead of finding a sword that's +3 damage, you might find a longer sword (though it would swing a bit slower), or a shield that is shaped like a bowl so you can store up projectiles from enemies and fling them back at them, or you might find a pinball flipper.Left click and right click activate whatever is in your left and right hand respectively. So you could have two pinball flippers to use the previous example.  Swords or stick like weapons with swing. Shields would be brought from the side to the front of your character while holding the mouse button.And of course you could find projectile weapons yourself to live that crossfire game experience. though I would think I would tour around with balancing it around absorbing or capturing projectiles from the enemy or otherwise having limited ammo.Power ups or upgrades could modify the shapes that you found like giving them bounciness so your Shields could deflect projectiles with extra momentum back at the enemy, or stickiness so you could glue things to your weapons for a moment. I'm not sure if you would die by taking damage or getting pushed into hazards by enough projectiles or enemies.  but either way or both could work depending on how you balanced the game.
 
A game where you are alone in a spaceship and have to survive until the heat death of the universe 
The player would pass millions, billions of year waiting for processes to complete or for travel times by sleeping in a stasis pod.Most processes would have to be programmed by the player, for example turrets would could have several input variables of the velocity of your craft and an enemy, the speed of the projectile from the turret and distance. The player would have to take those into account and make a targeting script.Sensors would be based on reflection of visible-light lasers, radio waves or visual contact rather than abstract targeting.I acknowledge this is a fairly loose bunch of ideas but I think this could be *cool*.
 
Immersive & cinematic Fighting Game by ditching the HP bar...sort of 
I was recently watching a longplay of Mortal Kombat 11's story mode and it was like watching a movie, until it seamlessly transitioned to a fight. Except it wasn't seamless because now people were getting impaled in the head (not an exaggeration) and shaking it off... ... ...But really, all fighting games are like this. Take a less bloody game like Smash Bros. When the greatsword wielding Ike slams down on an opponent, and if they don't get knocked out of the ring then they get right back to fighting.**HERE'S MY IDEA**Instead of Hit Points, you have Dodge Points. Ok, ok, I know this sounds waaay too simple, but I believe it's as awesome as it sounds. You dodge attacks until you run out and take a fatal blow.A more complex variation would be to allow you to take damage that limits you when your dodge meter is depleted. Such as your arm being hurt, or in pain momentarily, disabling punches. And same for legs and kicks.Perhaps this meter regenerates slowly, so if you back away and recoup you can keep going, even if hurt.***That's all folks!***
 
an apocalyptic survival horror game about utter desperation. 
this is the end of the world as we know it, ravaged in every way possible, there was no hope.in this game you will never have enough resources, always trying to make the best of the worst it could possibly be. the gameplay could be made in a bunch of ways, third person, first person, 2d, text based, but it has a general theme and setting in mind.**hazards:many things are out to kill you, or worse.***enemies:they live, they move, they kill.*brutes:brutes are a type of creature that like the name relies on brute force and strength to kill you. very dangerous in normal circumstances but lack the cunning to outsmart you. essentially mindless beasts.parasites:parasites are a type of creature that takes advantage of the human body, horrible creatures that could be hidden anywhere. be careful, because if one catches you it could have disastrous effects on your body and mindpeople:in these times of desperation even those who were previously good men may attack on sight, beware as since they have survived as long as you they may be just as cunning.*environmental hazards:in these times even nature wants to kill you* smoke:when you breathe in smoke you have a high chance of suffering from various health problems, so you should protect your lungs in some way, or just stay away from it altogether.wear and tear:the toxic rain, the rough ground, the degrading nature of the air itself, it starts to deteriorate your clothes, so unless you repair or replace them, your clothes will eventually become broken and incomplete, leaving you vulnerable to the elements.dreariness:the fact that this world is so bleak and depressing may chip away at your will to live, so you should try to find any hope to grasp at, lest your emotions have an effect on how hard you try to live.**items:one of the only things that don't want to kill you.***weapons:use these combined with some cleverness and hey, you might even be able to kill a brute.*pocket knife:the starting weapon, low reach, medium durability, low damage, only good as a last resort and even then, it can barely kill a parasite.bat:medium reach, medium durability, medium damage. an all rounded bludgeoning weapon.spear:long reach, low durability, medium damage, can be thrown. useful for spacing or being thrown, but doesn't last very long.machete:the ultimate melee weapon, medium reach, high durability, high damage, extremely rare, treasure it if you manage to find it.guns:there are two types of guns, the pistol and rifle, the pistol is easier to handle and find ammo for while the rifle is longer range and more powerful, you might want to rely on these since melee combat is dangerous but you cannot as ammo is rare and guns are noisy.*utility items:these will keep you alive in this harsh world*water:you need to stay hydrated or else you wont regenerate stamina and eventually die of dehydration.food:you need to stay fed or else you wont regenerate health and eventually die of starvation.gas mask:wear this to keep safe from smokenormal clothes:wear these to keep safe from harsh weather and terrain.log:use this to make a campfire to warm yourself and sleep.helmet:where this to keep safe from head attacks and certain parasites.**the goal:because every game needs one.**the goal is simply to survive. eventually the brutes and parasites may go extinct as this world was too harsh and lifeless for even them, as the last few people find a new hope as the dust settles and nature regrows, leaving a open ending hinting at the chance of rebuilding.

You play as Gordon Ramsay navigating a large and dangerous mase full of bad cooks, horrible restaurant owners and delusional hotel owners all hunting down Gordon while he trying to locate lamb sauce. When you get closer to the lamb sauce the enemies start to move faster and Gordon moves slower. If you get caught you will die and start over
 
What happens when you turn on friendly fire, put 4 people, several dangerous items, traps and monsters, and a door to freedom where ONLY ONE PERSON CAN LEAVE AND REAP REWARDS? Find out in a game called THE DOOR. 
A 2-D platformer game where a procedurally generated dungeon that kinda looks like Speunky's various levels. It is very expansive, and spawns you at the top, giving you an objective to get to the bottom and go out the door. It takes about an hour to beeline to the exit. And about 2-3 hours if you explore the entire dungeon thoroughly.&#x200B;Four strangely desperate travelers are dropped into the entrance of the dungeon, and with a final wish of luck, set off on an adventure. Enemies and death traps are common, and some of them either need a specific item to unlock/pass or even the teamwork of multiple people. Every adventurer starts off with a backpack that can hold up to 5 items, as well as their machete. Your machete applies hit-stun and knock back, which allows for you to engage in a Smash Bros. type fighting style with various weapons.&#x200B;Remember though, friendly fire is turned ON. And sometimes, you and your adventurers will find that you disagree with each other, and a melee brawlout will break out. Once an opponent/hapless victim of accidental death is dead, they can be resurrected using your ankh. Each adventurer has an ankh on hand that can only revive someone 3 times per game. Die four times, forget to send your party a friend request, then you are removed from the game and will likely never meet them again.&#x200B;There is a door at the bottom of the dungeon. A door which has a stone wall that closes when one person enters it. The person who exits it will receive a cool skin/hat, while the others? Nothing. It doesn't give the person who recieved the skin/hat an advantage, but rather a status symbol of being the one to reap the rewards of four people's effort. The hat given to you is based on how well you and your team worked. If you killed all of your teammates and entered the door alone, you will be given a hat that marks you as a murderer. A good teammate that works together and is elected using the in-game poll system gets a hat that marks them as a person worth spending time playing a game with.&#x200B;Items in the game are plentiful, and they can be weapons, futuristic devices, enchanted items, books of knowledge, all that kind of stuff. Here are some examples of what you might encounter, **by order of rarity, with the last being the rarest item in the game**:&#x200B;**The Grappling Hook:**Use your mouse to aim. Can attach to any surface up to 15 units away and pull you towards it. Attach to allies to pull them towards you. If equipped with feather boots, you will instead pull yourself to them.&#x200B;**Feather Boots:**Fall slower, and also enables double jump. When activated, you pull yourself towards allies with a grappling hook. You can deactivate the item with E.&#x200B;**Martial Arts Scroll:**A scroll depicted many useful images of people not agreeing with each other in the most violent manner possible. Gives you +25% damage on your current weapon, and also offers a longer attack combo for melee weapons.&#x200B;**Dusty Revolver:**Pew Pew. Fires a dusty bullet that deals 25 damage(50 max health on any player) and knocks enemies back.&#x200B;**Katana:**Left by a wise old man who thought it was a good idea to live in a monster infested dungeon. Deals 10 damage in a slash. Can combo attack.&#x200B;**Ninja Scroll:**Melee weapons now reflect projectiles in the direction of your cursor.&#x200B;**Jet Boots:**Must I say more?&#x200B;**Crate of Bombs:**A crate of **50 bombs**. Straight from your sponsor today! Bombs can be used to blow up obstacles and kill people/moral values.&#x200B;**Tome of Powerful Speech:**Activate to speak a word that kills any creature in a 50 unit radius under 50 health. 60 second cooldown.&#x200B;**Laser Rifle:**Pew. Pew. Pew. Pew. Pew. Destroys terrain as well as your opponent's will to live.&#x200B;**Ultra Teleporter:**Mark up to 5 places in the map, and teleport between them freely.&#x200B;**The Idol of Fashion:**A small statue that appeals to the Hat God, spawning 3 extra doors at the end of the dungeon when used, allowing your entire team to reach the end and get a special hat.&#x200B;Apart from items, mobs can also spawn in the dungeon. Some are passive, some are neutral, some are hostile, and others just want to make profit. Here are some examples of mobs, list from weakest to strongest.&#x200B;**Cave Cow:**A cow that lives in a cave. Whoever thought that was a good idea? Drops meat that temporarily increases speed when eaten.&#x200B;**Slime(Hostile):**A smol slime. It just wants to hug! The hug consists of you and your bones melting in acid. Jumps at you and deals 5 damage on contact.&#x200B;**Skeleton(Hostile):**Possibly another adventurer, but now its just a pile of bones that wants to practice his archery, with you being the target! Shoots arrows that deal 15 damage on hit.&#x200B;**Enchanted Pufferfish(Neutral):**Swims around in the air. Pick him up and throw him, and on contact with any surface or mob, it will extend its spikes and deal 10 damage to them. Hitting a pufferfish will also cause it to puff up. There is a 10% chance that it will do a super puff, which makes it expand to 10x its size and deal 30 damage to anyone caught in its wrath.&#x200B;**Shopkeeper(Neutral):**A shopkeeper that lives in a family-owned business underground. In a dungeon. You can buy things from him, but steal his items or hurt him, and he will chase and hunt and (maybe) kill you. Armed with a shotgun that shoots 5 pellets each dealing 10 damage and a bad attitude, try to stay on his good side.&#x200B;**Devil(Neutral):**An evil devil from the underworld. Will wait for an adventurer to come by, then bribe them with gold or items to do tasks that usually involve killing your teammates. If you accept the bribe and don't do the task in 15 minutes, he will come hunt you with the intent to kill. Wields fire breath that deals 75 damage and a pitchfork that deals 25 damage.&#x200B;**Fake Door(Hostile):**Spawn near the end of the dungeon, and pretend to be the door that leads to freedom(and hats). But if a player tries to go through it, it will eat him, deal 50 damage to him, and then spit him back out and start teleporting around the map, trying to consume your squad by appearing where walls should be.&#x200B;**Ghron Kahir(Hostile):**A red door with a skull knocker marks the entrance to his personal dungeon, where you can fight him to get an extremely rare item: His head. Which grants you the ability to zoom out and see the map further and predict obstacles.&#x200B;So the point of this game is to have fun, don't kill each other, laugh at hilarious deaths, and by ALL MEANS. Do not eat the banana. Please. Just don't. Goodbye.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;**The Banana:**When eaten, there is a 50% chance that the consumer will turn into a banana monster that is literally just a block of banana sprites pasted together into humanoid form. Sear yourself into the minds of others and induce insomnia by using this ~~weapon.~~
 
Hello I am 14 y.o school student and I want to make a simple game. Does anyone have an idea?) simple game time killer or tycoon maybe platformer??) 
 
An rpg where after every level you pick one of three stats to level up and the boss fight is a boss with every stat you didnt pick throughout the game. 
 
A game where you can draw your own world and visit drawn worlds of other players 
It's a game where you start in the empty 3D world and you can draw the environment and its inhabitants, they convert into your 3d world as 2d images rotated to the camera (billboards), I think the "alive" objects can move and maybe have some simple procedural animations. The main point that you can visit other worlds made by players and rate it or interact with it in some ways(need to think here), so it's like an asynchronous multiplayer. What do you think about this idea?
 
Ideas for a procedural planet game, please 
I've created a procedural planet system in Unity. It works like a charm and looks stunning, but I cant think of any interesting game idea/mechanic using it. I've spent more time working on it than I'm proud of, and I dont want to scrap it - HELP!
 
A Battle Royale, but its Horde Survival with Teams of Players, like COD Zombies in an Open World 
I just thought about an Idea and I think Fortnite has had Halloween Events similar to what you might think of when you imagine this Idea, but I will explain my Idea nonetheless.Imagine a Battle Royale with a very vertical and open map, jumping between buildings, wallrunning, dash moves etc, first person. When I think of the movement I think of something a bit slower and more methodical than Quake, but faster than COD, recently played ULTRAKILL and really think something akin to that would fit well. All around the Map are Loot Chests, Random Drops of Loot and Horde Enemies who might drop better loot, you can rush through the map with your team of four and kill as much as you can. I imagine these aren't fodder zombies either, there are tiers of different horde enemies to kill, even some that might resemble a miniboss that can actually keep up with your movement, I think most enemies will be shooting since else they wouldn't do much harm to someone who can move as vertically and fast as the players. You'd have to kill some of those Miniboss enemies to get better gear. Now I think this will be a battle royale in a different style than others, since you won't have to worry much about other players, there won't be as many. They only become more problematic when the map shrinks and you now have to work around zombies and players to survive. Still think last one standing would be the most fitting, no other win condition like many battle royales tried recently. One of my biggest gripes with Battle Royles and why I don't play them as often is that there is so much downtime that when action actually happens, you kind of need to get back into the groove. So having action to keep you on your toes all the time without the fear of people who might not be too skilled having a bad time because they just get killed by more skilled people who they werent ready for sounds like a good idea. I'm terrible in battle royales and I always die to some dude who literally curbs-stomps me because I wasn't ready. Making you always on your toes by filling the map with horde enemies and making players more noticable by giving them insane movement will give people more time to prepare and be ready for the next firefight. hopefully giving people who originally didn't like BRs for their action cycles a nice one to play.
 
I honestly think this is a great idea that fits you peoples guidelines. 
WARNING: I spilt this up so you could get an idea of each requirement for a game, I want to thank u/Sir_Magic for his post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3kf4ty/why\_your\_game\_idea\_sucks\_and\_how\_to\_make\_it\_better/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3kf4ty/why_your_game_idea_sucks_and_how_to_make_it_better/)) it allowed me to follow some guidelines and come up with a layout. PS: sorry for the bad use of grammar, I never really learned how to use commas and periods. Sorry this was so long I just thought this was a good idea.**CONCEPT**: (to be honest I was just getting sleepy and thought of cubes) so the game I was thinking of would be an FPS where each match is a 1v1 in which each player starts with a single bullet and a gun. When the gun is fired the bullet exits, and if it hits someone small cubes become detached from the victim and those become ammo for the victim’s gun (it would leave an entrance and exit hole through the person) but you gain health each time you hit someone. (this is a very simple concept, I just thought it would be cool to have others' ideas added to it) Also, an optional thing would be to add the ability to take some of your own health away to make bullets.**GAME SIZE**: the game shouldn’t be a game that requires next gen graphics, if you want the game to have better graphics then that's up to you. (by that I mean the game size is up to you I just want a game with the core mechanics I mentioned).**GAME STYLE**: think of Super Hot kind of cubes, how when you hit someone the part explodes and becomes cubes (of course there would be less cubes) it doesn’t have to be in the style of super hot, I just thought it fits what I was thinking. Though you can make it whatever style you want.PS: not sure what the flair "request" is I assume is a request for someone to make the game, and I would be happy to see it be made.
 
Nomad Caravan 
This is just a broad idea that could be anything. Actual desert nomads, traveling merchants, some sci-fi nomadic space travelers, whatever you can think of.The basic idea is a ‘caravan’ which can be any sort of large moving entity that you can lead to different points of interest. This caravan can be upgraded and expanded and needs to be managed. Aside from that, you also have a first person character that actually goes out on his own to explore and find new places for the caravan to go to. You can then collect resources, research new upgrades, maybe some form of base building?I think this would lend itself fairly well to procedural maps and some survival elements, but again, this is just a broad idea that I hope jumpstarts someone to think of something cool on their own.
 
Reverse leveling 
How about a game where the progression is reversed where you start fully leveled up and as you “level” you are forced to pick one of your skills to get rid of. This could plan into story line too if your character gets sick/hurt/aging. I’m not sure how fun it would be just thought of it randomly.
 
Enemy Guards and the Elementals 
For context: Top down 2D Stealth Action GameEnemy Guards want to live as badly as you do. If they find a good looking weapon, they will equip it and leave their old weapon. So don't go dropping your fucking rocket launcher unless it's empty, mate.In addition, enemy guards can run out of ammo, just like you. They do not have infinite ammo up their ass. No. They will go to a weapon room and re-fill their ammo there. They can also go to the weapon room if their weapon was stolen while they were asleep.I should mention that it should be possible for weapon rooms to be destroyed with explosives. I know I can easily implement weapon rooms being destroyed by explosives, but a idea from you on what should happen if they are all destroyed would be very much appreciated.If a corpse is discovered by a guard, said guard will stand in front of it and call a slave to carry the corpse to a emergency room.Said slave will be a earth elemental. It will carry the corpse away and "revive" it.(If the corpse belonged to a guard, turn the corpse into a guard with a random patrol path)The earth elementals are really friendly, big tree people. They only get aggressive when they see a fire. When aggresive, they will attack everyone. Including you.There are also other elemental slaves. Water Elementals can be called when a fire has been spotted. Water Elementals always come with a escort made up out of two guards because they are more defiant than Earth Elementals. They will only attack the player while there is a guard near them. When there is no guard nearby, Water Elementals will immediately attempt to flee.I think there should also be an interaction if a earth elemental and water elemental meet...Oh and of course they wouldn't be limited to only appear when a guard spots a corpse or finds fire. They will also appear in the level itself, being bossed around by those darn enemy guards.Oh and one more thing:If a enemy guard is injured (less than half of their HP, poisoned or bleeding), they will go to the emergency room themselves and get healed there.What do ya think? Sound good? Sound fun? Got a suggestion? What should the interaction be for water and "earth" (or maybe I should call them forest) - elementals? What other elementals should I consider adding?
 
Your own retail business 
Make a game about two brother rivals who’ve been competing ever since they were kids, and decided to end this battle once and for all by each having a retail store across the road from each other. By the end of the year, the more successful retail store would win. The game is about creating your own, custom retail store, all the aspects of hiring workers, upgrading it to attract more customers, expanding and adding more products, making friends from the local town, etc.I doubt I’m ever gonna make this so if someone finds this idea worth it (or the concept) you can take it!
 
We should have weekly idea prompts, similar to game jams 
I would love to see this subreddit post some sort of weekly prompt that could be used to help generate ideas, and provide a place for all of us to post how we would take the prompt and make a game out of it.&#x200B;For example, I was in a game jam and the prompt was "Don't touch it!"  I made a tower defense game out of it, but other people had a tons of other ideas.  It was really interesting to see what kinds of things others made.  So, hopefully something like that can be started.  What would you all do with the prompt "Get off my back!
 
A Cooking Game where your objective is to assasinate a target 
 \*\*Main Concept:\*\*The main idea of this game would be to be playing as an assassin who disguises themselves as a cook. Think of Hitman, but instead of just being able to slip some rat poison into a meal or drink,  the whole game is based around this meal killing your target.  \*\*Setting and Plot:\*\*The game would of course take place in a kitchen, the kind of which would depend on your mission. It can range from a local family restaurant to a five star restaurant. In this kitchen, it would be your  job to assassinate a target someone paid you money for to kill. \[Maybe you kill the original chef before hand and put on his clothes or turn  into him with some special kind of technology, this part kind of  depending on how realistic or futuristic the game world itself is, which  I can't really decide on.\]  \*\*Gameplay Mechanics:\*\*The biggest part of the game would be spent preparing food.  You'd have a recipe you would have to follow, and also additions to put  in to finish your job. It could be as simple as putting in a few drops  of poison, something more advanced like putting razors into the meal so  the victim's throat is cut up, or inderect things, like messing with the  tableware or making your target have to visit the bathroom, where you'd  go and take care of them.To make the game interesting, and to make it so players  can't just rush through everything and add a bit of poison in the end to  kill everyone in the same easy way, there could be several obstacles.  Some of those could be:* There is one specific target, ordering just soup.  Killing innocent people is bad, so you have to find a way to kill your  target without making the big pot of soup itself dangerous (Maybe you  can replace the oregano on top of the target's soup with something the  target is allergic to)* The person who gave you the job wants the target to die in a specific  way. Maybe the want to get revenge for something, or they are following  a holy codex \[They might have found a loophole in their holy book and  are using it to justify casuing somebody's death.\]* (In later levels) People have become suspicious of restaurants and started to check their food more, making it more likely that your  assassinations attempts will fail if you try doing the same thing over  and over again.* You don't know who your target is \[possibly because of a codex, or because there are several people fitting the target's descriptions\], and  you have to figure out who your target is before actually trying to  kill them.  \*\*Additional Features:\*\*To not only mention main features, I think you should be  able to buy new weapons with the money you get from completing missions.     Also, there could also be a Suspicion-meter, that would go up if you do  something suspicious in a mission. The more experienced the people who  see it are, the faster it would go up. &#x200B;\[Extra Ideas\]Lastly, I'm thinking that taking over the chef's role would  also be a part of every level. Maybe just a tiny thing in the beginning  where you have to press a button, or maybe even a little minigame. Of  course, it's just an idea, and it's always possible to just throw the  player into the kitchen without worrying about the first part instead  &#x200B;I hope I didn't put too mich detail into my post. I put  things that could be ignored into brackets, is that enough? Is this kind  of thing too detailed? Should I make it more simple the next time I  post? Did I mess anything else up? Please feel free to critisize!
 
An RPG where you can only progress by deleting previous saves. 
(Haven't researched whether or not there is a game similar to this idea. Also haven't decided on a genre)Basically the plot of the game is that something, or someone, has been terrorising the world for ages, always ending with the world being destroyed. (Or a save being deleted, outside of the game) The main character is the only person who remembers their experiences from the previous world. With every save that's deleted, more paths would become available to take, revealing more possible ways to stop the destroyer.The basic premise I came up with:It's the earth's final days, society is just gone. Everyone's already said their prayers, and most have given up. The only way anyone could have stopped this is if someone had convinced them in the past that this thing was real. Fortunately, or unfortunately, you just so happen to be that very person.Let me know what you think!
 
A game where you make your own weapons 
So, I just had this idea:A game where you can design your weapons from scratch, adding loading mechanisms, barrels and all of that stuff, and maybe even being able to also customize the bullets of your weapon, and then see if your weapon works or not on a shooting range or fighting AI enemies with premade weapons.Edit: I am not talking about customizing existing  weapons, I am talking about creating new weapons&#x200B;
 
A demolition-derby racing game where your parts keep breaking and you have to steal parts from other racers... mid-race. 
**Junker GP**Every racecar is a lemon. Every car part threatens to break on you in the middle of the race. Every racecar has a pit crew *in the car* that dogpiles out of the windows to steal parts from adjacent cars... also in the middle of the race.****The HUD has a diagram of all your vital car parts (the four wheels, axels, radiator, engine, transmission, gas tank, etc.) and how close they are to breaking. As your car takes damage, along with regular wear and tear, the parts start to break on you.At any point, like a mini-RTS, you can order your in-car pit crew to start repairing the vehicle so long as you have the necessary parts and scraps. *Let's not ask how they're doing it while the car is running; let's just chalk this up to videogame logic.* But if you have the budget, it'd be comedy gold to animate this repair.To steal parts from other cars, you order as many crewmen you have available to cram out of the side windows. You then pull up to another vehicle on that side. Your crew will immediately engage in breaking random parts off from the other car. However, you can also direct specific crew members to target specific parts using the same mini-RTS interface.The other cars will have their own in-car pit crew to defend themselves. Opposing crewmen will slap-fight in pairs, so you'll either need to focus more of your crew to this task than the other car, or direct them to focus on stealing (which will open you up to getting parts stolen too).Don't forget, you're driving throughout all this. It goes without saying that you don't want to be way ahead of the pack in this type of racing game, or else you won't have parts to steal.
 
Racing game where you have to come in third place 
I'm imagining some kind of cart racer.
 
Presidents vs zombies 
A 4 player co op horde survival game with all 45 US presidents being unlockable playable characters.Each president has a unique late game weapon and special passive, offensive or defensive abilities. For example trumps ability would be “border wall” basically a barrier, where as Obama ability would be “obamacaring” which heals all the presidents. An example of unique weapons would be nixons “hippie blaster”.Each map will be set in different time periods and will use weapons from the era, the player can still get modern/past weapons from time rift shops on each map. Each map will have special zombies and a boss.Some Maps I’ve came up with:White House 2020Bunker hill 1775Pentagon 1962 Air Force one 1997
 
Road Trip - an online social VR game where you join strangers taking turns driving cross country in cars, vans and RVs. 
It's like a mix between VR Chat and Euro Truck Simulator. When you first start, you're spawned roadside signaling to hitchhike. If you aren't picked up, you can refresh to spawn ahead of some other ride.When you get picked up, you just hang out with people, talk, enjoy the passing scenery, stop at roadside attractions, get food at dive troughs, and all around have a fun road trip. Players can take turns driving the semi-automated vehicle.Once you're done, you can ask to be dropped off. Or worst case scenario, you jump out the window.What else can I say. I really enjoy road trips and they can make a great social setting in VR.
 
A horror game that makes you lose your mind 
It’s a first person survival game and a shadow will pop up on the side of the screen but if the player moves the cursor close to it it’ll disappear. Also there’s this thing called infrasound and it makes anything that listens to it sick so that could probably be playing through out the game
 
Reverse Soulslike - a game where you play as a series of powerful bosses against progressively smarter heroes. 
 
A game similar to Dead By Daylight, but survivors are bank robbers and the killer is Batman trying to stop them. 
 
Ghosts vs Humans PVP game. 
[MIGHT ALREADY EXIST.]A game similar to Dead By Daylight where there's a team of ghost hunters and you're a ghost. As a ghost, have to mess with the team's equipment (draining batteries, moving things,) without getting caught on a thermal imaging camera. You can't be caught on video if you're staying still, you only become visible when you move.Points are awarded to the ghost player by draining batteries and moving furniture, with a proximity bonus multiplier. If a ghost is caught, then the ghost is "dead" and is done playing for the round.Points are awarded to the hunters for evidence, with a point streak multiplier depending on how many pieces of evidence they recovered. The team with the most points win.I know this is crude and probably isn't half as complex as some of the posts on this thread, but this was a very spontaneous idea that I wanted to get jotted down before I forgot it.
 
I have a idea for a game. Tell me if it's a good idea or not? 
It's a space trader/smuggler game. You start off with just a crappy ship and buying a selling little products. Eventually getting better ships and getting bigger deals. Going to new systems and such.  You can start getting other workers and building automated trade routes. Though the real fun would begin when the products your buying and selling could potentially lead to economic issues on planets, you could fund wars and aid certain groups. What do you guys think? It would be in a first person point of view and you'd have to do emergency repairs to your ship if something happened.Edit: Just to clarify, this is a game im working on. I just didn't want to get too deep into it if it was gonna flop hard Haha
 
What would you do in a physics based bird flight game that's meant to be more relaxing? 
I keep coming back to this idea - I want to make a game about flying as a bird where you use the joysticks and triggers to control your wings. I've built out the basic flight gameplay, but I'm stuck on what to do with it. Flight is fun, but feels off without some sort of goal... Any ideas for goals/additional mechanics?The best I've got so far is that you have to migrate to avoid an encroaching winter, so you're constantly having to fly "south" but that isn't much.Taking a nod from survival games, maybe you need to keep up a hunger meter by hunting and you lose more hunger by flapping excessively?Or maybe something more arcadey?
 
May I request ideas on making a better jump? 
I’m curious what defines a good jump. I know details like a kick of of dust upon landing and/or when initially jumping depending on the “strength “ of the characters jump can make a jump appear more dynamic. Does a static jump speed simulate control or is there more control in controlling jump velocity and / or height by holding the jump button? What are some thoughts and feeling on stretching during a jump animation? I’m investigating concepts to make my game more fun.I currently have a game on the google play store called Fungi Monkey. In said game the characters jump from one side to another avoiding enemies. I want to take some of the views and ideas discussed here and investigate what I can to to improve the feel of the jumps in game.
 
Amphibitious 
  Imagine a game similar to the survival game rust, only the player when spawning in can choose to be an aquatic animal, a land animal, or a volant animal. This game harbors each creature with pros and cons and leaves the player to choose what they like and how they like to play.     This game would bring things to the table, such as player verse player combat, factions, base building, adventuring, and role-playing. Different things would be possible with different species. Humans can wear armor and carry guns. Harpys can fly around at high speeds and have a great sense of hearing, merfolk can breathe underwater and swim quickly, as well as being able to see very well in the dark.     To balance the species, and create diversity, each type would have to have a downside. So the obvious "go anything other than human" is out the window. Humans, of course, can't breathe under the water, and can't fly, but they can of course have machines.   Harpys can of course fly around, but carrying heavy objects makes this impossible. Their bodies are also incredibly light to fit for flying, and in turn, they are very week and have a low amount of health.  Merfolk can't use any kind of tech, as you might have guessed, electricity and water don't go very well together.    This game could also feature things such as a building mechanic, and many places for you to find loot, as well as maybe mystical abilities, and stat changes. I don't know though, just an idea.
 
immortality, a game about seeking eternal youth 
in this game you play as a young alchemist whos life goal is eternal youth, and over the course of a lifetime you have to research the ultimate youth serum. there are other serums that do things like slow aging and bring back your age by a certain amount but most of them only work once or twice, while the ultimate one keeps you young forever. over the course of the game you gain knowledge and wealth. the alchemy would be randomly generated so every playthrough has different recipes, and so you have to make a strategy that isn't just trial and error.so what do you think of the idea?
 
Shapeshifter 
This idea is really special to me. So in case you're taking inspiration from this or making a game outright, I wouldn't mind a shout out.I'm also working on a prototype for this, so feel free to give feedback. Anyways.Just like the title. You play as a shapeshifter, preferably in a dark fantasy setting. No need for medieval periods.Instead of playing the hero you play the monster. You're literally EVERY and ANY monster there is. After all you can shape-shift into anyone or anything (not inanimate objects.... Yet)GameplayThe whole game revolves around surviving in a world that rejects you. You have to shapeshifter to survive. To eat. To live. You can't trust anyone: no one knows you.Shape shift into animals, monsters and even other humans. Oh that reminds me: to shapeshifter you need blood. Lots of it. It's like the fuel for your powers. Wanna sneak into a store and steal a food? Binge on some rat blood, shapeshifter into a rat and sneak in. Or drain a guard and assume his likeness. Good luck fooling their friends too.RPG elements also play in nicely: You gain fragments from the subconscious of your victims and these add "Perks" to you. You can add those Perks to a skill tree, but some Perks come with side effects.Missions are a lot more free from. You don't have any special destiny or whatever. Your goal is to survive, keep ahead of the predators in the wilds, monsters in swamps, monster hunters and the general suspicion of the populace. And if all else fails, you can always KILL your way out of aby situation. Think of it like Prototype meets the Witcher.Oh!!! I just thought...Mutations! The types of forms you have can influence one another. If you have a bear form and a goblin form you can mutate you goblin form to have fur, which gives that form NEW advantages. Every form has something cool about it, even humans (I can imagine shape-shifting into a sexy lady and charming the hell out of guards). You do what you wanna DO. Also be careful, some forms can be "allergic" to the other. Y'know, because science.Need a challenge? There's a food tree in these parts. Monsters on top, humans in the middle and the rest find their way into the dirt. Literally.You can increase your status on the tree: taking out high profile characters (famed bounty hunter, high level monster, etc). A little bit like the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor, but with a lot more variety. What else? Let's see.... Maybe you can even make a "Frankenstein" of your forms. As a shapeshifter you don't have a true form, so you can "store" forms you collect (limited at first, of course). So what I mean is you can be a Chimera of sorts. A lion with firebreath. A human with bear strength and claws. A werewolf with wings (so cool!!)And.....Yeah that's the basic premise. Ideas are rather easy to come by IF you let them come and not force them.But as always, I want to hear from you guys. Ideas? Thoughts? Contributions? Invitation to join you indie game studio? (lol).
 
Deal with a Eco System Simulation and Human Tribes using your Skill and Technologies from the world you came from. 
#PremiseYou find yourself in a world in which most humans don't know how to use most technologies. The world still has a bunch of human-made items for you to find/build and use against the dangerous animals, hazardous plants and harsh environment. You will lure, trap, destroy your path to victory.Once you start finding, defeating, getting past and dealing with human tribes, you realise that they've acquired the ability to tame wild and dangerous animals.After a while, you will be able to find the four "Dungeons". Giant buildings, remnants of the past containing humans that have both learned to use technogies and have tamed animals.Your mission is to rescue your friends by gathering power, technogies and information from the dungeons. Pinpoint your friends prison and free them from the strongest and smartest human tribe which has captured them.I want the creatures of the system to be rather predictable, so no random gene bullshit for animals.#AnimalsSome animals will eat or harvest plants, others will hunt other animals. Of course they'd also need to drink from watering holes. Animals will reproduce until a certain amount of them are in the game.Basic Stats for animalsHealthHungerThirstReproductionIf a animal dies, it drops meat of different sizes.When a animal has satisfied all of it's needs, it will wander randomly.#PlantsPlants will have different growth stages. Some will start spawning "falling seeds", which will be affected by the wind.Other plants might have other ways of spreading their seeds.Plants will also grow faster when it rains or when near a water source. A seed that drops into water counts as a dead plant which can also be eaten.#Weather SystemPotentially adding a day/night cycle and sleeping behaviours for animals and humans.Wind would randomly broadcast a wind direction and wind strength to all seeds.Randomly start and stop raining.#HumansHuman Tribes likely won't work similar to animals.They will be guarding specific areas.Most of them will be guarding, patrolling their areas.Some of them will be seen fighting with other tribes or camping.Sometimes they will try to directly attack you or even manage to capture you.Human behaviours should include warning other humans and trying to heal them.They are armed with spears and other stone-age weapons. There are also some high-level humans who are able to tame animals and even higher level humans who can use technologies. Those will even create traps like spike traps and arrow traps.Humans drop "human meat". A variant of meat that can't be eaten by the player unless playing on a "Harvey" or "Easy" difficulty.
 
Stardew Valley style game set in a post apocalyptic world. 
I started writing out Video Game pitches recently on my DeviantArt page and thought I’d post at least the Elevator Pitch for some of them here in the hope that they might help someone.The first one is: A light farming simulator set in a world brought to the brink by an alien threat.
 
An FPS with different win conditions for each player 
*"You don't know anyone's motives. How can you trust even one but yourself?"*&#x200B;  In this 10 player game, you take place in a house or complex. Each player grabs items from the ground of one primary, one secondary, and one utility, along with a knife slot which is only affected aesthetically.&#x200B;  You can break walls as in Rainbow Six Siege, but not completely and not every wall. Upon killing others, you receive one "Gratitude", which can be redeemed at a shopkeeper on the map for better weapons or utilities.&#x200B;However, each player is assigned an "Ambition" at the start of the game. Ambitions alter what things they start with and their goal. They do not always alter starting items.&#x200B;  Examples:  "Pride" - You want everyone to know you're the best killer. You win once you kill 3 people in full sight of 3 other people.   "Sacrifice" - You must sacrifice victims. You start with the "Sacrificial Knife" melee item, which is aesthetic. Each melee kill has the body dragged underground by a dark force. With 4 melee kills, you may enter the "Old One" form, where the entire map is abyssal and terrifying. From here, you win by killing one player. &#x200B;"Justice" - You have an agenda to uphold. You start with a "Police Badge" utility, which can be held to prevent being targeted by automatic aiming systems such as turrets or landmines. You also start with "Handcuffs", and win by arresting 3 people holding a Bomb or Automatic Weapon.&#x200B;"Vengeance" - You are avenging a loved one. You start with a "Paper", which can be held to show you who your target is. Once you kill the person on the paper with no one witnessing their death, you win.&#x200B;"Profit" - You are scavenging for quick cash. Each gun you pick up may be sold to the Shopkeeper for 1 Gratitude. You win by having 15 Gratitudes. You lose 1 Gratitude on death.&#x200B;"Honor" - You must uphold your code of honor, and hold others to the same. You have a meter called "Honorbound", which goes up to 10. You start with an item called the "Tombstone". You may gain honor by:  Martyrdom (Dying to a knife)Burial Rights (Planting a Tombstone on a recently killed corpse)Dueling (Killing someone with a Pistol)&#x200B;You lose Honor by:  Killing a player only holding a pistol with an Automatic Weapon.Taking a weapon from the ground that is clearly not yours.&#x200B;&#x200B;Aside from the moral and ethical message this game tries to send, I think it works in theory and chaos.
 
A permadeath game about rebels. 
Just had an idea for a game where you play as a series of rebels. Each character is permadeath and specific to the level.If you die, that mission is over and based on how far you got, what objectives were completed and how many rebels were left alive determines the end status of the mission. From there its onward down the line of rebels you play as. The endings of each mission can effect later missions, and all together effect the end of the story. It's possible to die immediately in each mission and get the worst ending possible after only 5 minutes. It's also possible to survive each mission and have a bunch of rebel heroes to inspire other people to join the rebellion, making future missions easier. For example I'm imagining a 2 part mission where you need to go in stealth and sabotage a base before a large assault. Phase 1 objectives are 1) cut the power to cripple base defenses, 2) kill the base commander to disorganize the troops, and 3) blow weapons cache to prevent resupply, cause chaos and signal the start of the attack. These can be tackled in any order but it would have consequences. Cutting the power before killing the commander allows for easier movement through the base but puts everyone on alert and power is restored in a few minutes. Killing the commander first means having to get to him without being seen but there is more chaos/confusion when the power is cut and it takes much longer to restore. Blowing the cache first ends the mission and signals the assault team to move in while the base defenses are hot and the troops are organized and ready with leadership from their command. Alerting anyone during the stealth phase is almost surely a death sentence. Depending which objectives where completed before dying affects what you have to deal with on the assault. There is also the option to call off the assault if you no longer think its feasible. It will save the rebels from a morale hit from the casualties of a failed assault but will make a future mission harder with reinforcements from this base. I imagine a limited number of missions that max out at about a half our long on a successful play-through. If the game could be completed in about 3 hours I think it would be compelling to play through the whole thing multiple time to do better and explore unintended consequences of mission outcomes.
 
Two players. One is blind, the other is deaf. 
My first time posting here so forgive me for any issues. I'm not a game dev at all but I think this is a really really good concept for a game and I wanted to share it so it might inspire someone who can actually write a line of code. Basically it's exactly what the title says. There are two players, one is blind and the other is deaf and they have to communicate and rely on each other to survive a world of obstacles. There's no voice chat for obvious reasons so you have to figure out how to communicate with each other so you can navigate through the world.
 
Need help with my game! 
So I've been working on a small game and I feel like it's not finished yet for publishing.here is a YT link to see some raw gameplay of the game[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1\_Mq\_B-5Xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1_Mq_B-5Xo)but my question to you is:* What kind of upgrades can you buy whit the coins you get?* What kind of cosmetics would be cool?  (like different color backgrounds)* What kind of upgrades can you randomly get while playing?
 
A game idea I want to see but will probably never get made. 
**In the case this game actually exists, please direct me to it.**My idea is for a *I Am Legend* type game, only no zombies. It takes place in a 10 years overgrown New York City that has been quarantined after an incredibly infectious flu virus spreads globally from Hong Kong (this idea began long before COVID-19 so there is no correlation. It's based more on SARS). It has a story similar in design and execution to *Red Dead Redemption 2* and your biggest threats are other survivors and wild animals. There is little looting and scavenging because, come on, it's been 10 years since everything was consumed, so you do a lot of hunting, fishing and gathering. Apartment buildings and skyscrapers are vertical habitats and alligators inhabit the flooded sewers, subways and tunnels. No cars so your biggest method of transportation is probably going to be horses and carts. Oh, and get ready for tons of *The Walking Dead* style quick time events as everything from lighting fires, picking berries and skinning animals is done through them. If any game developers are reading this, please rip it off. I won't even ask for royalties. Just make it, please.
 
Bigfoot survival game where you play as bigfoot 
I've been playing a lot of survival games lately like DayZ, Rust, The Forest, etc. I've also been listening to some podcasts about bigfoot.Which gave me the idea, someone should make a game where you play as bigfoot, trying to survive, feed yourself, shelter, etc while also avoiding encounters with man. Single player would make the most sense, since you would want the AI for the humans to be pretty simple.&#x200B;Maybe you could pick from different environments, like:&#x200B;1. Semi-rural. You live in the woods near houses, so its a lot more likely that deer hunters and kids might be around, but you have a lot more opportunity to get food from the garbage and supplies from around the houses to build your shelter.2. Remote, your 100 miles into the canadian rockies from the closest town, but its much more difficult to forage.3. Rural. There are some farms nearby where you can steal pigs and chickens and pilfer supplies, but you still have to be careful about hikers and hunters, but not as much as semi-rural.&#x200B;There would be a camouflage button, where you can stand still in the brush and "disappear" when humans are nearby, unless they get too close. If they get too close you can growl or something to scare them, but if its a hunter there should be a chance they could shoot you.&#x200B;A "bubble" around things like security cameras, trail cams, etc so you know how close you can get.Then a sort of "wanted" system like Grand Theft Auto, so if you get seen too many times by people or cameras, or steal too much food / supplies, it increases the likelihood you'll have hunters come after you with guns.&#x200B;The game itself being "how long can you survive?" If you chose a semi-rural area, you're going to have less game to hunt to feed yourself so you have to take from houses, which increases the chances you get found and shot. Or if you chose remote, its very easy to not be caught, but much more difficult to feed and shelter yourself. This allows players to decide if they want to take the Metal Gear method of sneaking around to get what they want, or do they want to do the brute force survival mode where food and supplies are harder to find but less sneaking.
 
You're in a group call but some people can't hear each other 
The basic idea is that you're Discord voice chat with a group of people but unfortunately, some have muted each other and some have partially muted themselves (not everyone can hear them). No one has the information of who can hear who - you gotta figure that out by talking to each other.I thought of some specific implementations which seem fun:**Figure out the communication network**One person is assigned as the "IT person" who is here to fix this mess of a call. But first, they need to figure out exactly who can hear who. And they'll need some information relayed to them because they (probably) can't hear everyone else. The IT person will draw a graph of persons/connections and submit this "IT ticket" when they're done. Objective is to submit a correct IT ticket as fast as possible.**Task chaos**Kinda like Spaceteam, where people are constantly shouting instructions at other people to complete their individual tasks. Or it could be like a whisper down the lane/telephone style where one person is given a riddle and another person has the answer.**Hidden Eavesdropper**Everyone is given a unique secret key. One person is assigned as the eavesdropper, who can drop in and out of conversations of any connected group of people. Everyone else is a "secretkeeper". The eavesdropper needs to collect all of the secret keys, and secretkeepers only need maybe about half of the secret keys. (The eavesdropper does have the information about who can hear who from the start.)Additional elements?* bi-directional connections only, or also allow one-way connections* change the network of connections periodically during a round* add talking bots for additional persons
 
A Mario game where you play as kidnapped peach, sabotaging Bowser's traps and attempting to escape 
The game goes as follows:A normal day in the mushroom kingdom Peach gets kidnapped by Bowser and his goonsonce you reach Bowser's castle, he goes to celebrate. But forgets to lock your cellYou leave the cell, and now, it's a stealth game in Bowser's castle, if you get caught, you get sent back to the start and more security and enemies spawnYou can attempt to sabotage Bowser's traps for Mario (removing enemies from stages, disabling hazards) but these cost lots of time, and you could get caught!In singleplayer however, you cant do this. You can only attempt to escape the castleIn multiplayer, if you connect to consoles together, you can play a co-op mode. Where you can spy with Mario and tell him what you have disabled so you can work together if Mario has a difficult obstacleThis would require to have a Mario world or 2 but this game is primarily on peach's adventure so the manpower and strain won't be that much on quantity of Mario's levels, more on having few interesting and challenging levelsThis was just a thing I was thinking about earlier and wanted to share with you all
 
A game about people who have been shrunken and captured by Aliens for a cosmic tv show about humans surviving in a new terrain. 
For many years there have been aliens secretly capturing and shrinking humans to be used for entertainment for a cosmic tv show.The Story would mainly focus on an average mechanic who goes from a coward to a MAN. The Story will be about this man trying to find a way to free himself and everyone else from the aliens so they can get back to their normal lives. Although there are some people who like the way their lives are now since their new life is better than their old so they will be obstacles.I imagine the sort of vibe of the game would be Mad Max meets downsizing where there are various gangs of people who want to kill you to get supplies.Gameplay would be Dead rising meets yakuza in where anything on the ground can be used as weapons and you can combine things to make a stronger weapon and the game is a beat em up. Since you are basically in an alien tv show you will have to deal with things like alien made natural disasters and alien monsters on certain days. For the alien monsters some of them you cant just kill with brute force but you instead must create traps for them.Well thats my idea. Feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below
 
Augmented reality territory capture game that uses the actual night sky as the map (like Ingress in the sky) 
Gameplay is like Ingress with factions working to capture territory by linking points of interest together to create fields of influence, but instead of places on earth, the points of interest are objects in the actual night sky. You can only play at night and can interact most strongly with objects directly over your current GPS location. Brighter stars are more valuable, important, or powerful. Moon and planet locations create additional effects and interference. Special events occur with moon phases, equinoxes, and solstices.
 
“conductor” A game about riding a train around a broken, dying world. 
In conductor you play as tuxedo wearing “conductor” who wakes up in a train with his head replaced with blue fire, like a willow wisp. I know it’s a tired troupe, but you can’t seem to remember anything about yourself, or even what this world is. You try to leave the train, but a barrier blocks you. The game is all about bringing passengers from one place to another, talking to them (and looking in the background) to learn about this world. The game would place a heavy emphasis on story and art, with gameplay really being walking around and making choices/talking with passengers. I have more idea for a story, but this is the general idea. It would work best as a 2d game in my opinion.
 
Modern Oregon Trail 
I just thought of this while driving. Oregon trail was a great game in its time and available technology. I was thinking how a modern version of the game would be a game I would love to play. Open-ish world concept with beautiful landscapes. Player based story mode.EDIT: My intention was to have a Oregon Trail game using modern (today) graphics engines and story telling. The idea was that the game would look and feel like RDR2 using an Oregon Trail concept & story. Apologies for the confusion.
 
A Stardew Valley-type game about Necromancy! 
(If this seems familiar, it's cause I posted it over half a year ago and I'm reposting it now so it might inspire someone)This is what I was thinking Gravekeeper would be like before I read into it and it was not (still a great game tho, check it out)You are an aspiring necromancer in a medieval town, filled with unique people. You want to take over the town with an army of undead, become rich, or become a lich.You yourself can't immediately go into combat. You are very weak and have no weapons, and those don't come cheap. You also have no bodies yourself.You could go to the graveyard to dig up skeletons, but they are extra suspicious if seen and they are pretty weak.The other ways of getting corpses involve... Murder. You could have dug up a couple skeletons and have them kill someone in their house, or you could just poison someone by slipping something you made out of the mushrooms in the woods into their drink at the tavern.Necromancing a body isn't as simple as casting a spell and it stands up. No, you need materials. Heal up any wounds that caused them to die, hold their bones together properly with straps, and maybe give them enhancements!You can use your minions to work on a farm that you own. Just don't let anyone see the ones that are decaying, skeletons, or just flat out ghosts.[Check out this mod for Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35378/) for some other ideas (obviously the game wouldn't look like that though, I'm thinking a cute pixel-ish style as Graveyard Keeper and Stardew Valley are)# **Potential Types of Undead:*** **Skeletons** are the weakest and most suspicious, but are also the easiest to put back together when an angry villager kills them. They can also be taken apart for easy transport. They have far less emotional impact than others if spotted, since they are totally unrecognizable from when they were alive.* **Zombies** are less obviously undead. You may need to embalm them and put makeup on so they don't rot as quickly and look more human. They are also more efficient than skeletons, but wounds on them will be much harder to fix.* **Revenants** are probably the best there is. Indistinguishable from real people and they work better than a normal person, but you have to raise them immediately after death. The rites involved in bringing them back also involve trapping a minor demon in the body and convincing it that it is the original person, now wanting to work for you. They will spend time with their family still, though. No suspicion about them going missing, but less time spent working. They also retain their memories, so they'll remember if you were their friend in life. If they find evidence of their death, they may seek out revenge on the killer (which could very well be you).* **Ghosts** are harder to get. You don't need an intact body, but you will need to yank their soul out of Heaven. They aren't suspicious unless someone gets close to them, but they can turn invisible and go through walls to avoid people.* **Mummies** take a long time to make, are suspicious due to their wrappings, but are _very_ efficient. They are practically unstoppable in combat and can curse those that they don't kill with a glance.* **Monstrosities** are made out of multiple bodies stitched together and brought back using a lightning strike going through a magic rod. They are more intelligent and strong than a revenant, and they can pass as a normal (albeit ugly) human. They might shirk their duties to explore the village. They might fall in love with a specific villager and never tell you. Then you might end up killing that villager. Monster is not happy.* **Wendigos** are also very powerful, but you can't control them at all. The player doesn't know this at first, though. You don't make them the same way you would a normal undead. A living person needs to eat human flesh. Due to your heroic blood, you don't turn from eating it yourself (you just get sick). It is a slow process. The target will become more pale and will go to the store to buy food more often. Eventually, they will try to kill the nearest other NPC (even if its family). They will then eat them, fully turn, and run off into the woods. A series of attacks and raids on pantries makes you realize that no one can defeat it but you. You must set up a trap (which you can also use on human and animals) for it. If caught, you may either kill it or attempt to tame it. Taming is resource intensive and you will need to get it either _a ton_ of animal meat, or a pretty big amount of human meat.# **For the Story:**You have lived in the village your whole life. Your father was a great adventurer. He saved the village from a lich many years ago (there is a statue to his deeds in the town square). He kept trophies from that day in his estate and farm that he retired on.As you grew up, you would read all the books around the house. Then you found the Necronomicon, which used to be the lich's. You really wanted to try out that real, honest-to-goodness magic, but you couldn't get an opportunity. Then your father died. You were so excited to bring him back, but the bastard went and got cremated.But that won't stop you. You _will_ try the spells. You set out to find and/or make a dead body.No one in town recognizes you, since you only rarely left your house.# **NPCs:**One of the villagers seems pretty shady. If he finds out about your "practices," then you wake up in the middle of the night with him standing over you. He reveals that he is a lich, an apprentice of the one your father killed. He offers to decode parts of the Necronomicon for you, for a price. The price isn't always in gold.An old man is still angry at you, your family, and all adventurers because your father once broke into his house and broke all his pots. He is automatically suspicious of you. If you do anything that makes him more suspicious, he investigates your farm. If he sees a monster, he dies of a heart attack immediately. His bones are too frail to make a good skeleton and his body wouldn't hold together as a zombie. You have to bury him before they go looking for him.# **Rituals:**Rituals will involve ingredients that you must harvest from the forest or buy. Most will be found from the Necronomicon.Not all of them involve raising the dead. I won't mention those ones here since they should be pretty simple, but I'll put ideas for methods if you want.* A **Suggestion**-like spell that lets you influence someones behavior for either the day of the casting or the next day. You change their schedule so that instead of, say, going to the store, they instead go to the tavern. They get their drink, go outside, leave it sitting, go somewhere else, then come back to drink it. While they are gone, you could poison it. Or you could have someone go into the forest, where a group of undead or a beartrap waits for them. You need a sample of the person and some Valerian Root, though. Maybe some spit wiped off a mug or a hair that you take off of their bed. Or maybe the storekeeper decides to keep the place open for a while. If anything goes wrong and they notice, they will break free from the spell. Depending on the amount of Valerian Root used in the spell, the suggestion can last anywhere from a single hour to several days.* A **Calming** spell. It makes people far less suspicious of incredibly suspicious behavior for a few hours and they can build emotional attachments to you quicker. If cast on someone who is tracking you down, they will give up their search temporarily. You need a sample, just like the above spell. You also need Chamomile Petals. The amount of petals used can drive the spell from a fraction of an hour to several days.* Spells that **Alter Weather**. The different spells will have different effects and varying levels of suspicious-ness. You can make it rain, storm, or snow so that people don't explore the forest (where you will be sacrificing a live victim or some other sinister deed). However, snowing in the summer will be suspicious, as will a warm day in the Winter. There may be some components out there that let you cause some slightly less ordinary weather phenomenon, like tornadoes, rains of daggers, a supernatural fog, or make it start raining cats and dogs.* A **Divination** spell. Don't have the time to find out someones schedule, find out what they are doing in that locked shed, or want to see them die from your poison without having to be there? Just buy a crystal ball, get some incense, then relax and spy on it all! You get to see a visual representation of their schedule for the next week and you can spy on what they are doing right now!* A **True Ressurection** spell. Did you accidentally poison the wrong guy? Fall in love with someone, but they try to deliver you flowers and get torn apart by hordes of the dead? Well, high-level necromancers will be able to _truly_ bring someone back. They will have no memory of the hour before their death or their afterlife. It even works no matter how long the person has been dead, and they will be completely demon free! Thing is, to truly bring back a life, you have to truly take one. You must murder someone in an unhallowed site (an abandoned graveyard, a ruin in the forest, a previous murder scene, etc.). Their body will be totally evaporated and their soul will never reach an afterlife. Your lover/wrong target/torture victim, however, will be good as new!The last time I posted this, someone asked>In this game idea of yours, what would be the moment-to-moment gameplay?Here's the answer I put, for completeness:Well, your goal will likely change throughout it. Build relationships with the villagers, avoid letting your minions get seen, and have your minions do the grave dirty work on your farm. When you decide you need new servants (old ones becoming decayed or wandered off to be murdered by an inquisitor), you try to find a way to kill one of the villagers, and you have to pick wisely. Not everyone is an asshole that has it coming.You would also try to accomplish goals to get money or materials to give to your good lich friend so they can decrypt the Necronomicon.You may also need to defend said book and your other treasures later on from hired thugs, clerics that find out your secret, cultists looking to resurrect the previous owner of the book, and just other necromancers that want it. The stealthier you are, the less likely for any of those to happen, though the more magic-based ones could find you even if you are the stealthiest in the world thanks to their seers.There is also procuring the materials for your rituals, like lichdom and resurrecting stuff. There might even be other rituals, like ones that make it rain the next day so your undead don't have to be out as long or so you can change someones schedule, or use a voodoo doll to make someone want to go somewhere they normally wouldn't.
 
Reverse bullet hell game 
Basically, instead of playing as the small spaceship that has to destroy the alien mothership to pass the level, you (and your friends) ARE the mothership, and your task is to destroy any would-be rebels that are out to liberate the Universe from your tyrannical clutches.At the start of the level, the game screen has two displays: one fixed to your immobile mothership and the other tracking the lone rebel ship. The display tracking the lone rebel ship goes away and the one fixed on your mothership fills the screen when the rebel ship reaches the mothership.While the rebel ship is far away, the crew of the mothership has to collect resources from space trash, nebula gas, asteroids rich in metal ore, supply depots, etc to upgrade weapons, armor, and shields and/or send NPC-contolled fighter sorties in the hopes of destroying the rebel ship (or at least severely maiming it) before it reaches the mothership. Players can use the display tracking the rebel ship to see how well (or terribly) their fighters are doing against the rebel ship and to size it up.A mothership consists of 4 hardpoints which can be manned by up to 4 players (unfilled hardpoints will be AI controlled). Each hardpoint may be equipped with two resource collection units, two ship units, and two weapon units. The configurations for each hardpoint are player-selected before the start of the level. Certain configurations will have pros and cons. For instance, a beam cannon does high damage and is a hitscan shot but it is slow charging and the rebel ship will likely try to take it out first; a spreadshot turret fires slow projectiles but it fires a wide angle volley that is more difficult for the rebel ship to dodge. As a tribute to traditional bullet storm bosses, hardpoints that are symmetric to one another in position (ex. No. 1 and no. 4 if the left-right order is 1, 2, 3, and 4) will get a random weapon enhancement bonus if they have the same weapon configurations.Destroying the rebel ship yields gold and unlocks which may be used in the next level.
 
Hit points are depressing to me. It's sort of a reflex to just have HP/MP, like a game designer stopped doing their job..." -Tarn Adams, creator of Dwarf Fortress. What are some interesting alternatives to the standard Health and Magic Meters? 
Dwarf Fortress uses a wound-based system, where different limbs and body parts can be damaged independently and in different ways. What are some other interesting alternatives to the regular health/magic bar?
 
A game I'll never make: In a planet inhabited by machines and ruled by mechanical deities, one robot struggles to uncover the meaning of a secret he was told at his creation: that none of this world was real. 
The Lifegivers are the only ones capable of creating a robot. Each one bestows a different gift: a body, a name, a fate, etc. For an untold amount of time, they were all content with endlessly creating. After an untold amount of time, Meskhenet grew tired of endlessly watching the suffering and violence down on the world, endlessly sending her children to their deaths, endlessly making more to replace them. When it came time to instill yet another fate in yet another robot, she whispered a message: "None of this world is real." It was such a short, simple programming, but it would lead to the destruction of the entire cycle--after the deaths of many of her brothers, sisters, and children.**Story:** The game would likely start with the player, the robot, attempting to break out of the Robot Underworld (I don't have many official names but Robot Underworld definitely isn't one of them). They've tried many times to break out, but the underworld is teeming with violent machines, and even when they make their way to the end, bloodthirsty Ammit quickly puts a stop to it before they can even lay a finger on Anubis. However, after yet another failed attempt, the snake of chaos Apep gets a whiff of a good opportunity to do what he does best. I'm not sure exactly how that interaction would go down (fighting Apep would be awesome, having Apep as a friend or guide that pops up every now and then would also be awesome) but regardless, afterwards the player gets a tool or skill that enables them to fight through the Underworld, slay Ammit, and defeat Anubis. I'm not sure what happens from there, but it involves a lot of fighting, until eventually the player gets to the final boss Horus. There they find out Horus is actually a biosuit that housed the last human, left behind by his species for crimes unknown, who spent the rest of his existence creating and programming the foundation for everything as they knew it.**Setting:** Far future on on a planet, maybe Earth, though if it were it wouldn't really look like anything we'd recognize as Earth. Only the deities have even minor knowledge that humans once existed on the planet, and (this could be tweaked) only Horus and Meskhenet know the truth about their world. The Lifegivers would chill on a big structure way up in the sky, where they'd make their bots and send them down to the planet. I'm not sure if every single deity found in Egyptian mythology would be included, but I am sure their appearance would be more symbolic or inspired and less literal--that way there could be way more interesting bosses than just having Osiris, Isis, etc as human-shaped robots. Additionally, I probably wouldn't stress too much on being too literate or historically accurate, like making sure the Robot Underworld has the Hall of Two Truths or recreating the lore of how certain gods came to be.**Tone/Aesthetic/Vibe/Also Setting:** Shiny type of future. Think chrome, holographic, rainbow steel, a world with synthwave as its soundtrack. I'd like to go so far into the future that buildings and structures start looking pretty abstract. Let's not worry too much about what the robots use for fuel or why they have emotions or why some robots are vendors and others are criminals. Let's focus more on fast-paced fights in dope shiny robot cities, gleaming chrome pyramids, going toe to toe with a boss who's got a mohawk made of lasers, that type of stuff.**Gameplay:** I go back and forth between the game being an open world where you're free to roam and the game being more of one boss battle after another and the player experiences the world while traveling to the next boss. Either way, there'd be plenty of fighting with different weapons. After defeating bosses and maybe certain enemies, they'd drop stuff that you could use for yourself, from weapons and armor to things that would change how you fought a bit more; one example is a boss whose torso can spin around while he attacks, so you can defeat him and use that for yourself to overwhelm masses of enemies. Another is taking down a boss with some jetpack wings and then do flying attacks and maybe have access to secret areas.I'll stop myself from spewing even more and creating an even longer post! Even though I won't get to the point of being able to make such a game, I'm still compelled to think about and work on my little world of murderous robots. I can be terrible at getting what I'm envisioning across so feel free to ask questions or give feedback!
 
There should be a horror game where you go into an abandoned military base and for the first half, the monsters torment you and you are powerless and just run, barely staying alive. Then you reach the center of the base where there's a massive cache of insane weapons and then...then it's your turn. 
 Basically, first half Outlast. Second half Doom.
 
Cooperative FPS games where instead of bullets you only shoot powerups at eachother, trying to get all players to a certain place most efficiently 
 
Open World Survival game set in Dante's Inferno 
In Dante's Inferno hell is described as consisting of nine concentric circles, which mark a descending scale of sins that humans are capable of.That sounds like the good basis for an open world survival map. You would start as a soul dropped on to the outer most ring, purgatory, and would have to move through the rings to get to the center. Each ring would be a different biome with its own enemies and resources. Possibly a boss of each ring that you would have to beat before moving on. I think it could do well if it was structured like Valheim.
 
A game where 100 people are in a little world and they have to work together to survive. 
I dont really want this to become a game, so much as it is a simple thought that might be cool to share. That really is what i feel about the subreddit.So the core premise would be that you would be teamed up with 100 more people, and be placed in a randomly generated world of medium size, nothing crazy like Minecraft’s world but nothing too crowded, and the idea is that everyone has to cooperate to not die for 30 to 50 minutes. If you get killed, you cannot respawn and have to be sent back to the lobby. Kind of like a mixture between Fortnite and DayZ.
 
Please for the love of God, somebody recreate an actual good Train Simulation game 
# TL;DR - A new Train Simulation game should have a very fluid and straight-forward route/scenario editor tool like in Trainz, exceptional/realistic gameplay like in Run8, with beautiful graphics like in TS2020/TSW, oh and don't forget the multiplayer too.So if any developer who is experienced with making something and has a passion for railroads, please hear me out!So here's my deal here. I've played Trainz, I've played Railworks TS2020, I've tried TrainSimWorld during the Steam's free weekend awhile back, I've watched full gameplays of people taking *full* advantages of other Train Simulation games such as Run8. But each and every one of them have their what I would consider *major* cons;For **Railworks TS2020** (that I currently still actively play to this very day), it's the company **Dovetail Games** itself. They formed off of Electronic Arts awhile back, so already I'm not liking that fact alone. When they made this game a decade back before it got into Steam, it was actually really freaking good for its time. In the more recent years however they've been releasing buggy DLCs ***as is*** to this day, and they never bother to fix it letalone the fact abandon their older broken DLCs that they still also sell to this very day. I've learned to suck it up and deal with that, considering sound/physics mods will fix part of some DLCs most of the time. My big problem however with this engine is anything outside of the awesome gameplay itself. Sometimes tweaking things is a pain especially when there's a time I need to reinstall the game for any reason and everything goes back to default. Say I want to make a route/scenario for a route: The editor for this is ***atrociously ludicrous*** when you want to do anything, while it's *so* darn *simple* to replicate in a **Trainz** world editor itself. If you have a Train placed and set to go on a particular track, even if it doesn't directly interfere with your track and has totally different timetables, that's *still* enough for it to fail and not function completely. In **Trainz**, you place it down, tell it where you want it to go with several clicks, and that train is set to do exactly that. There's so much about the editor and the game itself that I can go on for days, but for a sake of this post criteria, I won't. I'm very well confident the reason they don't fix/improve this game anymore because they're trying their hardest to promote **TrainSimWorld**.**TrainSimWorld** also owned by **DTG**: Tried it, hate it. When they first released it, their first routes were pretty nice and paid pretty good attention to detail. At the time of the release they promised an editor and multiplayer. The game has been out since 2018, and they never delivered any of those. Nowadays their DLCs are just so bad, even some **TS2020** DLCs look/perform much nicer. Hell the 3rd party TS2020 content by **SearchlightSimulations** for example look/perform nicer than 90% of TSW's content. I am hearing promising things about TrainSimWorld **2**. But to say how TS2020 and TSW is done so far I'm really losing my hopes hence me turning to making this thread. I do not like the fact however that they're going to be both two separate applications. Meaning if I want to play legacy DLC from TSW2020 on TSW2, I have to buy TSW2020 first, then buy TSW2 to migrate all of that. The second installment should honestly be a free upgrade, so this also upsets me.I already briefly mentioned the pros with **Trainz**, so I'll only say what I don't like about Trainz. While the editor seems to be the only thing phenomenal about it, everything else just... isnt. The graphics is still pretty bad, even on **Trainz 2019**. The bad about the editor on Trainz is the lack of real world map overlays like TS2020 offers (other than importing "screenshots" of a small portion of the map you want to lay track on), so you're mostly stuck with making fictional routes. For gameplay, the performance is absolutely horrid. I'm not kidding. *It doesn't matter what specs you're running with*. When you move into freecam and try moving around, before it starts rendering really anything, the game completely freezes up, and has to be killed with task manager. **TS2020** almost doesn't have this problem; time to time it will have lag spikes and severe frame drops in very dense areas but recovers *fast*, and runs at full 60 FPS in suburban areas. Going back to **Trainz** however there's pretty much little-to-no recovery; you're stuck in your cab for the highest FPS you can grasp, and just pray your game doesn't crash everytime you have a 10-second long lag spike. I personally haven't played Trainz for years because of this.Lastly I want to bring up mainly Run8. I honestly don't have really anything bad to say about this. I've personally never played this but I'm hoping to eventually try it out. This in terms of simulation exceeds my expectations in realism and physics. It offers realistic multiplayer with voice chat using channels, with people who actually take the sessions seriously to heart, and I think that's great. My only complaints are the MSTS-like graphics and their lack of new development. I would understand the "gameplay-over-graphics" concept. However after awhile of watching the gameplay: the lack of good sound quality, weather details, and some other smaller details will eventually make me bored of the game itself especially if I were to play single player. I want them to eventually release more new routes to cover (especially in the northeast region of the United States), but granted getting licensing permissions from various rails is an absolute pain. It still is worth an effort on their part because somehow DTG is releasing routes much faster than Run8 are.# NOW FOR THE SOLUTION AND IDEAS!First and foremost that every game has that I consider to be problematic especially if you're a collector: **local files**. This maybe a bit controversial, but me personally the installation folder becomes a horrific mess and has caused game crashes for me. I prefer a client-based online/offline application with everything stored within the application core folder itself rather than an installation folder. The engine would receive regular updates to either fix a bug, or release a new train in the cloud. This way you can open the application and time to time discover bug fixes/releases. In offline mode, you'll also get the same updates, but you'll need to be connected to the internet to download them.Now I can see one big problem with this idea: "How will the developer make money with this method? Especially how will they put out new trains each update without directly charging the customer?" I would suggest to support the development by charging a monthly fee to use the ***multiplayer service*** *itself*. The reasoning for this (other than giving the developer money to support the game further) is to prevent trolls/those not taking a multiplayer session seriously. If you look at Run8, they from my knowledge usually host private multiplayer sessions with trusted people that join and take the run seriously. You don't want a kid joining and taking a freight train 90 MPH down a mountain and causing a catastrophic disaster ruining the gameplay for others.Now what about the editor? The editor can be used for the following things:* Making custom fictional trains/routes that you can play offline mode to yourself only.* You can also use the gameplay map consisting real routes that exists in real life and help the community out by expanding it by adding missing details, or extending a route if there are missing trackage that exists in real life. Then you can submit it to the developers for review, and give you proper credit if it gets approved for a new update!   * Especially in cities since they're changing all the time in real life, you can update small areas like a new building, a 5-year long major construction, a new track speed limit (in my area, a branch used to be 25 MPH but downgraded to 10 MPH because it's not used as much as it used to be back in the 80s), etc, etc.   * The developer can (temporarily) blur or modify a particular object, decal, or text if it requires licensing permissions from the railroad/various companies to present that publicly in-game.* You can also submit repaints of locomotive/rolling stock paint schemes that exist in real life too, or real life train 3D models that aren't in the game, and the correct sounds as well.   * Again the developer can approve these but can (temporarily) blur/modify little details of your work due to licensing permissions from the railroad to use in-game.The editor should contain **TOOLS THAT ARE SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TO USE!** I cannot stress enough how much work it is just to make a simple track work in TS2020. Making a junction to switch over to a different track requires a lot of precision or it won't come out right or at all. In Trainz however you can click on a track, a new piece of track follows your cursor, you click where you want it to stretch to, and you're all set. Joining the track is a same problem. You have to move your mouse until you find a connection point on the other track, and doesn't snap exactly where you want it to. Trainz you just click, snap, and modify a couple of spline points - that's it. Terrain tools are extremely easy with Trainz, and you can learn them in one sitting. With TS2020 they're very tough to master, especially when you want to create constant 1.8% grade increases/decreases. There are so many more things about the Trainz editor that makes it so much better than TS2020's, but I think I've given a general description what it feels like with the provided details.Basically I want an editor like Trainz with a world map overlay I can trace tracks over like in TS2020. It could use either ***Google Maps API*** or ***OpenStreetMap*** as a choice.Then lastly there's the gameplay. It should obviously have RailDriver and TrackIR support from the get-go. DTG promised they would have that support back in 2018 when they first unveiled TSW, but never happened. I would also suggest **not rushing on releasing the game** either and making the same mistake DTG did with TSW.The gameplay physics should be like Run8, but the graphics/sounds should be like in TS2020.This is all I have for now with suggestions. If anybody has any pros/cons I'd appreciate them. I'd love to hear out your suggestions for my idea, and what you would add or take away from my list of ideas.
 
A top down game where you run a refugee camp 
Like Rimworld or Prison Architect, where you have to build or erect facilities, ensure there is enough food, treat illnesses and maintain security. It could be rather dark, but you might get happier events like family reunions and weddings.
 
My idea is inspired by good-feel games like yoshi's woolly world and kirby's epic yarn as in it would be made of craft materials 
I'm open to more ideas to expand my ideaalso as in made of crafts i mean just implied it doesn't have to be really cool like the good feel games like the sun is a light bulb and the clouds are just patches, in my concept art I drew it as pixel art and the patterns I made to look like home made materialsI have this idea where one of my original characters has to save his kidnapped roommate, but the thing is is that his alien species has no arms and is just a ball with stubby legs which is just a little quirk which would just be a fun animation difference in cut scenes if any.It could be a level based game with a side scrolling 3D levels each with 3-5 collectibles or gems in each level and you have to unlock every 3rd level or so with the amount of collectibles required increasing each time.The combat style would be in the over-world (not in turn based battle) in which you attack by rolling forward dealing damage to enemies in your way. The boss battles would be unique and not just over sized enemies.the story would e as I said about rescuing the main character's roommate, Aster. All the NPCs would be from different made up species, yes I have made too many designs for them, they'd all be pretty similar within a species, with just little color change or a hat to make each at least a little memorableSpecies I've made so far\-Blublubs; the main character is one, they are just orbs with eyes and legs\-Co0Ws; quadruped sea cow faced turtle with a platypus tail\-Mupdle; basically ostriches with bald eagle heads and big eyes\-Dizzibei; aster is one, they are Sasquatch-like guys with barely any torso and gigantic feet, small face and hands\-Huffluffle; bowling pin looking guys with faces on the lower part of the pin, they crouch down and spring upward to move
 
Area 51 Tower Defense 
You play as the defender of Area 51 and have to place guards, turrets and other units to defend against waves of naruto runners, furries, gamers and other meme culture phenomenons. Higher upgrades could add some alien technology to help you put. If an enemy enters the base he'll find an alien there, so you better protect it!
 
A node-based magic system 
 [https://imgur.com/a/kwh7Wyi](https://imgur.com/a/kwh7Wyi)Instead  of the game having pre-made spells that you learn, you have to create  your spells with a detailed node system. Different node types include  feeds (to power the spell), actions, modifiers, conditions, etc.. You  could either power a spell with your own mana, have an ally project  power into your spell, rip it out of an enemy's body, or something else.The screenshot is an idea of what a simple fireball spell could look like.Any ideas?
 
As your blindness progresses you have to memorize patterns of play to eventually spend one day acting in complete blindness. 
Not sure, maybe it’s 2D. But your player has a specific set of tasks to complete on a regular basis, and over time you learn how this character has to live life to survive. It could be a short game, and the final “boss” is traversing that person’s life in complete darkness.
 
An RPG where every Item can be used as weapon. 
Pixel graphics, exploring, crafting and grathering items. You start with Basic stuff. Rock and stick. Battle system would be like in pokemon games. You can use items in combat in 2 ways. Throw at enemy, use in melee and - for special items - use/consume. Items would have attributes like: Better use in: melee/ranged attack. Large map. Quests. And RPG stuff. Most items would have "Physical" attribute, but rare, endgame items "Non-physical" that are useless on most bosses and enemies but strong agnist late-game creatures.I could help making game sprites and music.
 
Dreamt of playing this game, I want it to be real so much it hurts. 
I had a dream of playing this game last night and I cannot get it out of my head. You start out as an evil all powerful overlord who decides to leave the life of darkness and become good. Now, the mechanics of a normal game where you get stronger as you progress were flipped. You start out all powerful and crushing enemies with big strong attacks, however, your character draws their power from evil and darkness. So the further they stray from evil the weaker the hero gets. I basically started out crushing enemies easily but, over time, I'd lose height, strength, and armor. Slowly becoming a normal man and having to use quick, evasive, clever tactics to take down these giant beasts I once rivaled. In the end you start to draw power from light and and morality and use it to take down evil for good.There wasn't much storyline other than that but in the dream the game mechanics were so much fun, starting out as a huge powerful behemoth, then having to adapt and switch up your play style as you progressed. I woke up like, I need to play some more, only to realize it was a dream 😫I know it may seem vague or silly, but it was a dream so don't be too harsh 🤷Edit: I wanted to do a quick edit to clear some things up. First, I never really took this idea seriously. It was just a cool dream I had and wanted to share it with more people other than my boyfriend (I'm a girl btw, don't care about being called 'he' honestly, but I figured I'd throw that out there in case you cared about pronouns) I looked for a subreddit for video game ideas and posted it. Maybe it would inspire someone, maybe not. Had no further intentions than that if I'm being honest.Second, maybe I worded things poorly. The fighting system I had in mind isn't necessarily a reverse progression, nor do you get 'weaker'. Perhaps I threw that word around too willy-nilly. Just in general your character progressively turns into a normal man, instead of a huge demon monster. Thus the fighting style changes. I imagined something similar to the first GoW fighting style where you would press a sequence of buttons at the right time to do scenematic type attacks, to some of the mid bosses, harder enemies etc.. Ex: jumping on an enemie's hand at the right moment, running up his arm, and some neck stabbin'. The further you progress the more you get punished for your mess ups, mis-clicks, and failed dodges etc, considering your armor and such is gone. So in that sense, yes weaker here would work.Third, you would gain more abilities and speed. Higher jumps, some protective light, the less evil your character gets you do get bonuses. There is a reward system. It's not all punishment. But, as has been pointed out, the game just gets harder as you advance, like games do. That's how games work. I understand that. The uniqueness about this idea was the way it happens, and the battle mechanics changing, forcing you to adapt to it or die. If that's something people wouldn't actually like, so be it. I thought it was cool.Fourth, I'm going to say it again for those in the back that didn't hear me. This was all based on a freaking dream. I just played a cool game in a dream and I couldn't get it out of my head, so I shared. Thanks for the feedback and ideas though, some of them were actually pretty dope and made the idea better. I still don't plan on anything coming from it, but that's okay. Have a great day! Happy holidays! 
 
Kill The Chef 
The setting is a kitchen. You play as a random small object in the kitchen, be it an oven, a piece of food, a cabinet, or even cutlery. These objects can move in specific ways, such as sliding or rolling if you’re a small object, and maybe only opening or closing if you’re something large like a cabinet or oven. The goal of the game is to kill the chef in the kitchen. You *should* go about this stealthily, although the game wouldn’t just end if he spotted you. You, as the object in the kitchen, move around and use the environment, and your specific object qualities, to try to cleverly and quietly kill the chef. Maybe if you’re a tomato, you roll under his foot, and make him slip and crack his head on the corner of the countertop. If you’re an oven, maybe you slam the door to make him notice it and walk over, and then clamp shut on his head or something. There will multiple people in one kitchen at a time, all trying to kill the chef without being noticed. I imagine teams of people cleverly working together to kill the chef, or it could be a competition between a few people. At the end, when he’s killed, the game is replayed on a security camera screen. The idea is that it’s a funny/creepy security tape of a chef being killed by kitchenware. What do you think?
 
A Walking RPG (Mobile app to make walking/running more enjoyable for some) 
  Concept:The idea of this game is to get people to enjoy walking/running by turning it into an action loot game. I hesitate to call it an RPG because there is no need for a story, but plenty of opportunities to create lore and a universe for the game world. As you walk/run, your character will explore dungeons, kill monsters, find loot, and level up. There will be multiple classes that all have different functions. The best items will come from dungeons that you will have to enter in the app that you explore on your own (walking/running has nothing to do with these dungeons.) These ideas will be explored in more detail below.&#x200B;Core Gameplay: \- Using a pedometer (GPS may also be needed to prevent cheating, but I am not a developer, so I am unsure), the game tracks how many steps you have taken and gives you experience points towards leveling up \- While walking (choosing an option such as “explore” in the app could activate this feature or just make it automatic), your character will explore dungeons which they will automatically find loot (similar to the way exploring in Fallout ShelterTM works), although the loot wont drop higher than epic/rare (creative liberty) \- There will be selectable classes with possible multiple character slots (if multiple slots are not a wanted feature, permadeath/semi-permadeath could be an option) \- In game, there will be dungeons (once again something like Fallout ShelterTM missions, but with a bit more combat freedom possibly) where you can find legendary/set items to make your character stronger. Preferably, this feature will have group finder or allow to team up with friends to allow for a more challenging experience (online features also allow for trading and the like, but I do hesitate to mention PVP because it is not something I would personally think would be easy to balance in a free to play game since many money making options would be borderline pay to win)&#x200B;Classes: \- A possible money-making feature \- At least 3 playable classes   o Warrior   o Archer   o Wizard \- Other addable classes such as cleric, assassin, barbarian, etc. (These can all be free or purchasable with in game currency or real money) \- Unique abilities for each class \- Set items unique to each class’s abilities as well as legendary items&#x200B;Loot: \- Different tiers   o Common   o Uncommon   o Rare   o Epic   o Legendary/Set Legendary \- Possible rare/epic set pieces as well \- Lower tier items drop from exploration as well as dungeons \- High tier (legendary or epic+) only drop from dungeons \- Another possible money-making feature   o Loot boxes that take time to be unlocked (can buy instant opens and possibly find keys in dungeons for free unlocks)   o Different tiers of chests for different loot&#x200B;Dungeons: \- Harder instances where the player gets to make decisions and find better loot for their character \- Are unlocked by exploring and have finite uses (eventually they “run out of loot” and are fully explored as examples)\- Can be random or persistento If random they are new dungeons every timeo If persistent, when rediscovered, it could be due to monsters infesting it again \- Another money-making feature   o Dungeons could be found through items called maps (different tiered maps can make tier drops different i.e. an epic map has a better drop rate of higher tier items than a rare map)   o Maps could be purchasable with real money or found in exploration and dungeons \- As stated before, if online features are wanted, partying with other players (party finder or friends list) for dungeons would be a great feature&#x200B;Additional Notes: \- Leveling would be infinite with increasing difficult leveling and diminishing power returns in very high levels \- A stash would be a good additional feature with purchasable stash tabs (real money or in-game currency) \- If there are online features, an auction house would be a good edition&#x200B;Conclusion:Above are all the features for a game app that would help make walking/running a more enjoyable experience by centering a game around them. If there are any questions of features or suggestions, please post them in the comments below. Thank you for your time.
 
Game story idea 
The setting is an idealized small, 1950s town (at least it appears to be). You play an average dad with job, wife, 2.3 kids, etc. Your life seems Truman-show perfect, until you see a strange woman in the street. She yells, in a computerized vocie, that there is "danger" and you must "wake up". No one else seems to notice her. You brush it off and continue with your life. You're at the office, making water-cooler chit chat, when an alien monster appears from nowhere and brutally kills one of your coworkers. No one seems to notice. Things keep getting stranger. Sometimes the wall of your bedroom looks like a bulkhead, with blinking lights. Sometimes the gravity changes suddenly and everything floats for a while. The big reveal is that you're actually in cryosleep on a deep space exploration ship. To help your brain handle the extreme time you'll be travelling, the ships AI had created this false idyllic reality for you. The woman in the street was the ships Ai, and she was trying to warn you that *something  unknown has boarded the ship* and is killing the other sleepers. So the game alternates between the small town dream and gritty, alien isolation-lioe SciFi horror. When you're awake, you can move around the ship and try to hide from the alien. But you need to return to the Dreamworld periodically, whether to preserve your own sanity or just access parts of the ships AI. That's all I got so far. Inspired by a weird dream I had last night!
 
Driving simulator where you actually have to follow traffic rules. And then it gets weird. 
The most intuitive way to track player's performance would be using a score system, but I wouldn't make it too obvious: make bad performances being followed by angry comments by other drivers and chasing cops or something.But then, imagine the game being set in a city where every morning the mayor changes some traffic rules, and you have to read and remember today's rule to be a good driver. Absolutely absurd laws like today is legal to hit other cars and run over pedestrian but not turning right.It would soon make interesting and hilarious gameplay.
 
A third-person gardening/chore game in which you learn increasingly techniques to grow and maintain a property, but in the action-oriented later half of the game those techniques turn out to be combat techniques. Wax-on, wax off. 
\* increasingly *harder* techniquesThere's not much more to it. A short game with a simple story would work great. The troubled hero tends to a property, and an enigmatic tutor teaches him how to most efficiently execute tasks.The tasks grow in number and complexity to keep you running around, like a chore version of Overcooked. Unlike Overcooked, different actions require different button combinations.Halfway into the game, the hero's troubled past catches up to him, and all your training turns out to be combat training.
 
A concept for a puzzle (be honest if it sucks) 
There are 2 big skeleton hands laying still and a locked door. The left hand is completely dark and the other hand extremely lit. There are 6 spotlights in total with 3 on each hand (the left are all turned off and the right all on) you would have to quote "give them the same amount of light to open the door" by using 3 controll panells that turn on or off a number of spotlights (for example, the first panel could turn on 2 left lights and 2 right lights off.)The catch is that no matter what combination you put in, you can't give them the same amount. The only way to complete it would be to go to the spotlights and break them. With that, both hands are completely in the dark, technically having the same amount of light, which is none. The hands spring to live and open the door.
 
Things you dislike from game genres you like 
The point of this thread it's to get an idea of what other players dislike about their favorite game genre and take those ideas to create a concept either to make it better or rework that very thing.i'm posting mine as example:FPS* *Guns that feel & look like a toy:* unless it about toys gunfighting then it doesn't apply, since the first doom, i think it's outdated the idea of small guns doing little damage, the pistol becomes useless the moment you get another weapon. In Return to Wolfenstein Castle, and Wolfenstein: New Order, did an amazing job for giving an use for the 'low' damage weapons.
 
50 Player Competitive Rogue-lite/Hades-style Game 
Just had an idea I wanted to expand a bit on (one of many, just never thought to look up a subreddit like this). So, I have been enjoying the hell out of rogue-lite games recently, and steam-charts indicate I'm not alone on this one.My thought would be to capitalize on this cultural moment by making a massive multiplayer, competitive ladder match.Here is my game flow concept:Round 1 will include 3 standard PvE stages followed by a PvP fight between two players. Potentially have a store stage prior to entering the first PvP arena stage.Down to 25 players. Those who are out can use what XP they gained to spend on passives or cosmetic upgrades.Round 2 will include five PvE stages followed by a boss fight. For the third stage in this round I would consider placing either a shop stage or a mini-boss stage.After the boss has been defeated, the surviving players will move into the final round.Round 3 should be comprised of either three challenge stages (timed chest fights, timed health restoration fights, mini-boss rush) or 1v1 PvP arenas. The final stage should be a free-for-all battle between the remaining players. If this was a side-scrolling rogue-lite, perhaps this could be done as a race to the top of a platforming puzzle while fighting off other players. Maybe even an ending SSB-inspired fight.Definitely interested in hearing if this is something anyone else would be interested in, either playing or making!
 
What if the Sims would have different languages/ different types of Simlish? 
Simlish as a unifying language is fine and nice but wouldn't it be cool to have different types of Simlish (therefore different languages) in the Sims games?The languages would be handled like an ability which means that the Sim can learn the other language(s) by reading books or speaking with other Sims from that language group.When their language level is still low, they have only a few topics they can talk about and they are often misunderstood, which could lead to another Sim's embarrassment or anger 😬As they improve their skills, the variety of topics improves and they can also show off their knowledge and make a joke only linguists can understand.. I ... I mean I got a few when EA needs help with that 🥲Just a thought but I would love it 🥰
 
A systemic stealth game like Hitman, but it's not about assassinations; rather it's about smuggling cargo past layers of high security. 
Unlike stealth games, your character isn't trespassing and won't be attacked by security. Your character only has to worry about getting frisked/searched while moving the high value cargo, so you have to find ways of getting it past checkpoints in clever ways. Otherwise, you're a regular VIP in the areas you work.
 
How to replace the grappling hook in games? 
The concept of a “grappling hook” is extremely overused in video games. Are there any other traversal options that are similar to the grappling hook, but not exactly? Or are there ways to “revolutionize” the grappling hook, or make it more interesting?I’m asking this question because I am developing a moveset for a 3d platformer and want you’re opinion on this topic.You should be able to perform it in midair.
 
Pixar Lamp Simulator 
You're the pixar lamp and you score by smashing a maximum of letter.And you can switch the light on and off, for fun I guess, don't really know what else it could do.The lamp moves by jumping.Or the other way around : you're a letter and you must escape the pixar lampEDIT : I'm gonna do the game, I want to. But I need more ideas for mechanics and the name of the game
 
A top view stealth game where you control a contract killer on her way to kill a target inside a bulding. 
Objective: infiltrate, kill the target without being noticed by guards or witnesses and get out from the same door you came inAs weapons you can use a combat knife to kill or spit info from guards (points of interest or extra info about your target)  a handgun with a silencer that brake after 3 shots and the technique Rear naked choke to kill or put guards uncoscious to imobilize and hide them.I dont know if i can make simpler then this, i have a lot of more ideas but this is the base
 
Your health bar is your sword 
Just a silly idea for a game where you battle with your actual health bars. I envision this as a top-down twin-stick battler where you swing your health bar around to damage enemies. When you are damaged, your health bar shortens, which reduces your reach.This would be a pretty simple gimmicky idea, which could even work as a mechanic or specific weapon in a roguelite-type game.
 
A open world game that starts as a GTA clone and turns into a survival sim half way. 
**Setting**Set in the near future, on a futuristic island city that is only connected to the mainland  by single highway and a large airport and seaport. **Plot**The main character is an undercover agent, whose mission is to infiltrate the higher levels of a mysterious criminal organisation that's rumored to be indirectly controlling all the local gangs and according to some, even the police department themselves.Halfway through the game, the criminal organisation unleash a devastating terrorist attack that not only kill thousands but also completely isolates the city from the rest of the world.Now the main character have to survive through chaos and anarchy to finally confront the organisation responsible.**Gameplay**Before the attack, it's gameplay   is mostly similar to  other games of the genre.Unlike other GTA clones, most of the buildings are accessible and may have lots of useful stuff available for player (these building would be very crucial to your survival after the attack).Before the attacks if you committed any illegal act, you will chased and arrested by the local police,then get bailed out by your agency with a portion of your money deducted as compensation(depends on your crime). However there won't be any repressions for random acts of violence committed by the player as the law and order breaks down after the attack.You will lose your connection with your agency after the attack thus the digital overworld map of the city would malfunction  and you have to use physical paper map  that would only show more limited infomation than the digital map . There are also a lot of survival game features where you have to take care of health, food, and water(I am not sure what else  I should include).There are also a lot of side quests,romantic choices, variety of vehicles , weapons,clothes, radio stations(before attacks at least,after the attack, it's mostly emergency government broadcasts),etc.
 
A VR game where the lead character is in a wheelchair 
Instead of teleporting or slingshoting around I always thought it would be interesting to make a feature of being in a chair instead of working round it, an electric chair that can be operated with a joystick. This would probably lend itself more to a 'walking' simulator with investigation and puzzle solving as main ways of progression but someone more creative might come up with a better alternative.I know it's a bit vague but I thought it was an interesting concept and might seed some inspiration
 
A military strategy game with civilian targets 
Imagine a game similar to Total War, in that it combines turn-based strategy and resource management with real-time tactical control of battles. Before battles take place, a tactical decision comes in the form of deciding what to do with civilians, with different options carrying their own strategical benefits. And during real-time battles, civilian units can be targeted, and their uncontrolled actions affect the battle.&#x200B;Let's say you know an army is approaching one of your cities. You can evacuate civilians to other areas, but this will reduce the economic output of the city. And said civilians will be made vulnerable during their journey to safehouses. In building your cities, you can invest in bunkers and other hiding places for civilians to take refuge within. During the Swedish attack on Köpenhamn 1658-1660, attacking civilians was an integral part of the invading force strategy - hoping to create enough terror amongst the civilians to force their leaders to surrender the city.  The issue of how to treat civilians has historically not only been an ethical decision but also a strategic choice.  Once a city is taken, deciding what to do with the survivors would also be an important decision. Taking people as slaves provides resources, but ensures that other cities will be less willing to surrender. Using captured civilians belonging to the enemies as human shields can hurt enemy morale - but will also hurt once reputation. Giving captives full citizens' rights provide less immediate rewards, but some long-term benefits as the increased willingness of others to desert to one's army.  If one does establish rules to protect civilians, the harshness of these laws are also important. A soldier who rapes a woman within the occupied territory, should he be hanged publically or slapped on the wrist? The first will increase sympathy amongst the occupied, while the later will decrease the risk of uprisings amongst once own tropes.  Ethnic tensions would also play a role. Preferably this would take place on a different planet, where real-world ethnicities would not exist. Having been replaced by fictional population groups. Such as people whose skin has been colored gray and hair gold due to living in radiated areas for generation, and people with red eyes and blue skin. So as to make it harder for tasteless gamers to recreate hurtful historical abuses and posting them online (though modders would probably do that eventually).      Having soldiers occupy an area with a different ethnic majority civilian population, can exacerbate existing racial tensions. Which may feed revolutionary sentiment. When France sent black soldiers to control some occupied territories in Germany during the 1920s, a huge outpour of Swedish women protested against what they labelled "negro-terror" ([https://tobiashubinette.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/kvinnor-rasism-antirasism-feminism-elin-wagner/](https://tobiashubinette.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/kvinnor-rasism-antirasism-feminism-elin-wagner/)). If your country is ethnically homogenous, fostering chauvinistic attitudes might help defenses against foreign armies - increasing the likelihood that tropes from other nations will be rebelled against. But such attitudes increase the difficulty of establishing empire-building and tourism. Minority groups within ethnically chauvinistic regions will also face sporadic violence and harassment, in the form of lynchings and the like - with hurts the nation's level of law and order. As national research, one can invest in jingoistic propaganda and racial pseudoscience - or in community building across ethnic divisions.   The treatment of civilians can also be differentiated based on ethnic and religious lines. During part of the Islamic slave trade, only non-muslims were allowed to be taken as slaves in slave raids. And at other times all black prisoners of war, regardless of religion, were allowed to be taken as slaves ([Azumah, John Allembillah (2014/10) “The Legacy of Arab-Islam in Africa: A Quest for Inter-religious Dialogue” Simon and Schuster](https://books.google.se/books?id=IB29DwAAQBAJ&hl=sv)). Similar decisions could be taken to create highly discriminatory societies, or one can choose to be colorblind yet still cruel (treating everyone like crap, no matter what).
 
[meta] It would interesting to set up awards/contest and vote for our favorite ideas 
**edit:** I fucked up the title. Goddamn it. Like- Best AAA/Mobile/Indie/Abstract idea submission - The idea that has the most potential to be doable- What was this guy smoking when he came up with that idea?- Best innovative gameplay/mechanic idea- The most "I'm surprised this game hasn't been made yet"- The best contribution to the annual "So like Harry Potter or Pokemon but like Skyrim" etc. What do you guys think? This sub is pretty useless as it is, so why not make it something fun with the community? 
 
A zombie world game where you never be killed by zombies. 
Hello r/gameideas! I really want to share fresh ideas of my dream game. Sorry if my English is not good enough. Enjoy!This game name is "Pacifist", a wholesome zombie apocalyspe game. The protagonist has perfect immunity to zombies, it means that she can't be detected or infected. Moreover, there are people that have the same blessing, or only have one type of immunity. The non-detected but still infected is called "Ghost"; and the opposite is called "Knight". The zombie abilities are similar to the ones in Train to Busan.The protagonist (Evie) is physically weak, but instead has a bright mind. Of course, her main job is collecting and scouting. With her help, some survivors successfully built their own fortress. However, that's only the begin.There are still troubles, but Evie knows how to get through. As a player, your currency is Heart. Evie mission is winning love and affection from everybody. If she can't, she could be killed from any selfish/envious survivors, gangs of psychopaths, or mistaken/aggresive marksmen.Therefore, Evie collects people's favorite goods. Not only she brings to the base food, drinks, cattle, crops or other basic necessities; she also acomplish personal requests: she take back your pets, "raid" library for books, find games and music discs, "rob" some jewelry, etc. She can do everything with ease, as long as no living human shot her. And that can be solved too! Evie is ready to learn any instrument. A harmonica can help her a lot to prove she is sane and healthy, or lure zombies away. If she wants, she can play a whole concert for the zombies! The game will introduce you to variety of lightweight musical instrument and how to play them. When the goods are just too heavy, she can use neutralized zombies (no jaw and arms) to carry for her. Player can decorate those zombies and her truck, tame pets, or try if the sword is sharp enough by slashing a whole horde of zombies in sparetime.The game's main story is about Evie making peace between groups of survivors, escaping and defending from people who wants to kill her, and discovering secret lives of infected strangers. She must carry the huge amount of responsibility, knowledge and tatic to save every people she can. It's why people called her "Pacifist".Thank you for reading my post! This is just a dream, but i hope someone can make this very new type of zombie game into real life!!
 
A military game that changes based on the player's rank 
Here's what I mean. The game is a huge open war. When the game starts out, you're just a private and the game is a first person shooter similar to Call of Duty where all you do is follow orders and move to the next objective. As you level up, your rank increases. When you become a sergeant, the game switches to a squad based third person shooter like Mass Effect where you have to lead a small squad through the objectives. As a lieutenant or captain, the game becomes a top down real time squad combat game where you control a dozen or so soldiers and lead them through their missions. As a lieutenant colonel or colonel, it's a base building RTS like starcraft where you control an entire base of soldiers, construct buildings, and fight that way. As a general it's like a high warfare game like hearts of iron. You can make it all the way to the leader of your country where you decide the policy on a strategic scale.Thoughts?
 
An adventure game where every decision you make hurts you. If you die, the world carries on based on your decisions. Your ending is determined by how you impacted the world during your lifetime. 
Every decision you make, like picking a dialog option or doing something physical (ranging from what you choose to wear in the morning to pilfering a homeless person of all the money he has), damages you. Your health is never replenished, but it is quite plentiful. You can also often choose to do nothing at all, which won't hurt you, and instead lets the world determine its own events. If you choose to do nothing, you'll live longer, but your existence will become more meaningless.&#x200B;The goal, of course, is not to live as long as possible, but to instead affect the world in the way you find most beneficial. Maybe you want to be remembered as a poorly-paid dream follower, or forgotten as a member of the middle class.You must weigh the importance of yourself and others, as well as the importance of the present world and the future. Even something as mundane as what you choose to wear will affect what others think of you.&#x200B;Since the amount of decisions you make affects how long you'll live, the game can last as long as several in-game weeks (it will last finitely long; Sometimes you are forced to make decisions), or as short as a couple of in-game days.&#x200B;To add replayability to the game, maybe there could be random events with each playthrough to simulate how the real world is unpredictable. In some playthroughs, maybe you get robbed, or a decision yields a different result, or you get an illness, or a tornado arrives to your town.
 
A game where the multiplayer battles take place on two opposing giants that are also controlled by players 
Basically, the idea is that the battlefield is on the bodies of two giants, and that's where opposing players fight. That's the base mechanic, the rest is just hypotheticals I built up from that.If you're playing an average soldier, you're not only responsible for killing the opposing team, you also have to protect the your giant, harm the enemy giant, and traverse the giant you're on. Furthermore, if you're playing a giant, you have to not only attack the enemy team, you have to be aware of the soldiers on  you before making a decision because your choices could give your soldiers an advantage or disadvantage (because YOU are the battlefield).In combat, if you're a soldier on your giant and you want to cross over to the enemy giant, you have to wait for your giant to get close enough or be on whichever limb your giant attacks with.  If you're on the offensive as a giant, you could be hitting the enemy giant in the place that hurts the giant the most or in the place on his body with the most soldiers.Something I think that would be very important for this type of game would be realistic times and weight for the giant's attack. For example, a punch couldn't be as fast a typical human punch; I think it should take anywhere from a dozen seconds to a full minute for a giant to wind up and land a blow (think like Pacific Rim: the robots don't deal consecutive punches in a span of a few seconds, they need more time to build that energy because of their size).To explain this, I chose vague descriptions like giant and soliders. When I imagined this, I used ents cause I like ents. The soldiers could be different species of ents, with each species having a different niche to fill, and the giant would just be a bigger ent. I like using the ents for this ideal because it implies there's magic which opens up a whole other door to different things you could do. I'm proud of this idea but I haven't developed it in full, so please leave critiques or suggestions.
 
An Adventure puzzle game a la Zelda in which the dungeons are the 7 wonders of the ancient world. 
The Hanging Gardens could act as a forest/water dungeon, with vines you can use to traverse the levels, waterfalls, unique plant life, irrigation puzzles, climbable trees, etc.The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus could be the requisite undead level, slowly descending through from top to bottom, fighting through animated statues to the undead king at the base.The temple of Artemis could have moonlight based puzzles, like changing layout with the phases of the moon, bow and arrow fare, maybe some wildlife to fight.The Lighthouse of Alexandria could require an aquatic approach, with light-based puzzles, maybe to get a single beam all through the dungeon to light the way for a ship.The Statue of Zeus, since it probably couldn't house a dungeon inside, could maybe teleport you via lightning-strike to an Olympus-esque dimension with storm based puzzles (not electricity, mind you). like maybe there's a lightning rod you can carry around, but you can't stay under open sky for long while holding it or you'll get struck.The Colossus of Rhodes, drawing inspiration from the Talos myth, could be a moving statue that you have to get inside, from where you can control aspects of its movement in order to eventually get into the brain and deactivate it.The Pyramid of Giza, being the last one surviving , would be a fitting final dungeon. I could see it incorporating hieroglyphs, perhaps mummies, sinksand, or for a bit more of an unorthodox take, the ability to submerge into the afterlife via the book of the dead. finding more pages of the book allows you access to more sections of the afterlife, thus opening up more traversal options for the pyramid.Anyways, that's mostly spitballing. If you have better ideas, don't hesitate to leave them in the comments.
 
What to do with a powerful game server for the next 3 years? 
Heya gamedev, I bought a sweet compute-optimized AWS server on a 3 year contract for a web project that never took off. I've load tested it at 1,000 concurrent players over TCP (split into small sized lobbies obviously) and it only hit 60% cpu utilization!I'm looking to use this horsepower on a new project, can you think of a multiplayer game concept that would definitely entertain hundreds of concurrent users? I'm not really looking to innovate, I just want to make something small that people will enjoy and use, so my server isn't sitting around.I'm a career software engineer and have intimate experience with low level networking and client-server games, so don't worry about technical challenges. I just might not be the best idea person. Thanks!!
 
Sentient Brain trying to build a body 
Simple enough idea, you play as a brain in a jar at a lab, trying to escape by building a body. Using telekinetic powers you have to gather supplies and build your vessel without being caught by the scientists. You can use random objects and robotics as well as body parts lying around the lab to build your body, and once completed you must escape. Definitely a stealth and strategy based idea but I like it!

Dumping ideas from my journal 
These are all just ideas I've written over the last while and am never going to make. So, I'm sharing them in case someone else wants to.     1) Isometric camera, tiered level design, puzzle game.      You are in a haunted house or a mine full of monsters. The dark is bad. There are torches, lamps and environmental pieces like wood or oil that must be used to illuminate levels so you can advance.   But then things like starting a fire may close off options and trap you. Meaning you'll have to do things in certain orders to advance.        2) A weird dynamic management magic game.&#x200B;You run a cult of wizards or something. Think tower defence or strategy game. But you don't just spec into fire magic and then push to the end. Magic draws on the world and so at different times, different spells will be more viable.     This gets easier with an example.     If fire fights water then that causes rain and dark via steam and soot. So if there is a druid class or druid tree of spells those will be more relevant once the rain fulls more nature. Also water will gain power too. If they druids start making trees and other such things to grow their power then they create fuel for fire magic.  So this creates invisible power struggles that will drive the availability of resources, the cooldowns of certain abilities and the power of those abilities. This can be an RTS or a text-based game. It really is just about the balancing act of powers and the organic alliances that will be formed by mutual benefit.&#x200B;3) a shooting game where your armor is poison liquid metalYou need two resources metal ore for your suit and meds for your health. You are an unkillable war machine. However, bullets slow you down. Movement is momentum heavy so getting started takes a second or two. And if you allow yourself to be pinned down, then you'll waste time.    Your goal is to kill your way to the next resource managing health with the meds and armor depletion with metals.In my head, this is an Isaac or Gungeon style game, but you do you. 4) A game where you roll a ball that has a spike on it through levels. You use the spike to get over obstacles or make it through tricky terrain. But it makes moving from left to right to avoid blocks hard.The irregular shape and user input renders the puzzles intense and fresh even when used as elements slotted over and over again into new procedural levels. Because knowing how to clear something is one thing, but getting your spike orientated to do so while not hitting anything is another.I have more, but I'm still holding hope of making some of my little ideas.
 
Casual mobile game: randomly match two or more players and show them a set of choices. If they all make the same choice, they all get a reward, else they get nothing. They cannot communicate. 
Basically, a coordination game. Perhaps there's tags like in Omegle. As for what the choices are, I can see this being used for any kind of polling, as a way of gamifying it. One obvious notion for a prototype is to just get random imgur images from the internet, maybe four at a time (can those be filtered to get rid of NSFW ones?), and have the players choose from among those - likely the funniest or most aesthetically pleasing would tend to win. With more than two players, unanimity may not be necessary - rather, the reward may be proportional to the number of other players who made the same choice.What I'm not sure is, what the reward should be or why it would motivate someone to keep playing. It seems too simple. Collectibles of some kind? Resources for use in other minigames? I dunno, give me all your suggestions. If enough people think it's a good concept I may actually try to get a team together to build it.
 
Unfair platform duel 
You're playing a 1v1 melee platformer battle. Only a 2-3 successful hits wins you the battle, but the loser gets a power up or new ability. When the loser wins a battle later, they lose all their power ups (or maybe just a few?) and the new loser now gets a power up. Multiplier for wins in a row against an upgraded opponent.Some power up ideas:- Larger hitbox for attacks- Smaller character- Faster movement- Higher jump- Dash ability / longer dash
 
Realistic" fps with a unique respawn mechanic 
When the player dies their POV switches to an AI on the players team and they control them until the mission is complete or they die again at which point this repeats until every one of the finite number of AI controlled allies the player has have died then the mission restartsThe story would take the form of an anthology of unrelated spec ops missions all doing different parts of the same convoluted plan revealing each part to the player as they do it to tell a larger story connecting them allIndividual characters should be well defined enough to feel human but while still being able to get killed off at any second, imo this would be the most difficult part to get right
 
Some small thought-out (1-3 weeks) game ideas 
Since a lot of the ideas here are not that well thought-out (mostly genre + look of the main character + some story) i thought i would post some ideas with actual features, game mechanics and scoring systems that should still be fairly easy to make.If you actually create a game, feel free to post a video in the comments or send me a message, I would love to see one being made.Have fun:# Planet crusher (singleplayer PC, mobile, web):you are a planet in the middle of the screen. Other planets are randomly coming from each direction. You have to draw circles around them to let them explode before they collide with your planet.Drawing lines costs energy. Your energy refills over time and when destroying planets. The more planets you destroy in one circle, the more points you get for each of them.**Gamemode A:** endless mode, planets fly faster over time, see how far you can get/how many points**Gamemode B:** Waves/Levels where you can buy upgrades inbetween**Upgrades**: max energy, refill rate, bigger line, longer slowmotio, slower planets, an energy shield for your planet that can take 1 extra hit.**Optional features:** \-slow motion while holding spacebar/tapping with second finger. Refills only if you destroy multiple planets at once\-Upgrades can randomly appear on screen\-special planets can randomly appear that increase the points of all planets that are destroyed together with it&#x200B;# Lovers (local 2Players PC, web, console)2 players (wasd and arrow controls) are controlling two hearts that are connected with a bond. The screen is scrolling (vertically or horizontally doesnt matter) and new obstacles appear. Maybe saws, or little monsters that represent bad feelings for a relationship (anger, spite, doubt...)The hearts and their bond must not touch those obstacles.The bond has a minimum and maximum distance (so they cant just stack on top of each other). Also there have to be some fast moving obstacles at a right angle to the screen movement, so the players cant just form a straight line in the direction the screen is moving.As with every autoscroller your upgrade options are limited. Maybe some gold coins could spawn and the players can buy new playermodels that increase the score or gold collected. Some might even give bonusses according to the other player. For example green player gives 50% extra coins when playing with yellow and 30% extra score when playing with purple. I think you get the idea.**Obstacle ideas:**  \-moving obstacles in predictable patterns\-monsters that must not hit player A but player B can destroy them. These can even be barriers accross the whole screen so player A must be infront of player B or vice versa\-obstacles appearing behind the players and blocking 10-30% of the screen for some seconds. This forces the players to move closer to the other side where obstacles appear thus making those seconds extremly difficult&#x200B;# Apple maniac (local multiplayer PC, web, console)2-4 players move on a small 2.5D plane with a big basket. Behind them are huge apple trees where apples randomly fall down. Every player tries to collect as many apples as possible. They collide with each other and can slowly push each other around (animal crossing style).Each player has 1 shock charge. Players can shock each other when they are close to another consuming 1 shock charge. This disables the shocked player for x seconds but in turn gives him a new shock charge.Falling apples can also be spoiled. Collecting one of those will remove 1 point. During the game some events may happen. Apple rain, spoiled apple rain, normal rain and earthquake.**Apple rain and spoiled apple rain** should be self explanatory. These two exist, so that shocks can be  strategically important. Shock someone during the spoiled apple rain and they might catch 1-2 spoiled apples. Or save multiple charges to shock players during a good apple rain and collect all the apples for yourself.**Normal rain** makes players wet. While wet shocking another player will also shock yourself but still consume your charge and grant one to the shocked player.**Earthquake** causes a short screen shake and randomly swaps all players positions.&#x200B;# Gravity (singleplayer pc, web, console, mobile)A one screen 2D platformer where spheres appear in the sky and fall down to the ground.  The player must dodge those spheres, the game is over if he gets hit. They shatter upon collision and leave behind multiple shards. The player must collect those shards to get points. If there are still shards on the ground when the next sphere appears, it will suck those sphere in and grow bigger. Bigger spheres fall down faster and drop all consumed shards.**Additional features:** \-**The platforms have 2 sides:** White and black. They randomly flip during the game, some time the black side is top and white bottom, some time the other way around. The player can jump/fall through the white sides and stand on/get blocked by the black sides. The spheres also spawn in different colors. Black spheres only collide if the black side is on top, white spheres only collide if the white side on top. However both still collide with the ground.\-**Power-ups:** They spawn either far to the left or far to the right (to promote player movement) that increase his movement speed, collect all current shards on the ground, or stop the platforms from flipping for a short period of time.I already made this game, some **tips to juice it up**: \-screen shake on impact which gets more intense the bigger the sphere. \-Make shards leave behind trails when moving. \-Let shards fly in a random arc to the sphere when sucked in (bezier curve for example) and let the sphere make a small "pulse" or "bump" every time a shard makes it grow bigger.\-increase the odds of spheres spawning on top or close to the player. I found that equal distribution lead to the player just standing in the bottom left corner and being able to dodge nearly all spheres until they  grew reaaally big. Then he could just run accros the screen when a big one fell down easily collecting all shards at once.
 
In a hypothetical universe, I have unlimited time and budget to make a series of JRPGs with special features. But I ran out of ideas and want some of your suggestions 
So I had this idea for a while, which won't ever happen because of the amount of resources it would require, about a Final Fantasy-inspired series of JRPGs. Among other things, there are 2 features that stand out the most, and are a staple in every entry in the franchise, those being the probability-based combat system and the discovery system which is how the player discovers new things in the games.From what I have realized, all the discovery systems that I came up with fall under 4 categories**Standalone Object Discovery (SOD)** - There are**Combination-Based Discovery (CBD)** - A system where the player takes 2 or more object and combines them, resulting in a unique effect.**Observation-Based Discovery (OBD)** - A system where the player is required to observe their environment and choose anobject of desire. This system, for the most part, requires the player to use their imagination.**Time-Based Discovery (TBD)** - A system where objects reveal themselves to the player based on real time.**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**Anyways, I'm trying to come up with new ideas for both the combat system, which is based on a real-life aspect that already exist, and the discovery system. The problem is, I am dry out of ideas at this point. So I would like to hear what kind of ideas you, my fellow Redditors, might have with the prerequisites that I have set.This is more or less the entries that I currently have in the series. It is a summarized version of how each system works, since if I had to describe them entirely, it would take more out of me.#1st EntryCombat System: Dice; higher rolls means more hitsDiscovery System: 200 characters; just go around and find them (SOD)#2nd EntryCombat System: Unique system of combinations with 3 types and 3 numbers with 27 different resultsDiscovery System: 8 characters go around and place objects in designated locations to receive a summon, with 27 different summon per character (CBD)#3rd EntryCombat System: Based on Poker; different hands yield different effectsDiscovery System: Characters (amount to be determined) go around and transform objects, either everyday or peculiar, into creatures. Approx. amount of creatures: 200 (OBD)#4th EntryCombat System: Most likely based on either Pai Gow or just DominoesDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. There are 21 statuettes to collect; two can be combined, for a total of 210 different results (CBD)#5th EntryCombat System: Based on Chess; a deviation from the usual probability-based combat systemDiscovery System: Most likely has 2 playable characters. The player goes around and places objects in peculiar locations to summon mercenaries (OBD)#6th EntryCombat System: Based on Russian RouletteDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) gains different powers based on how long they waited in real time from a designated location, up to a maximum of 216 hours (9 days) (TBD)#7th EntryCombat System: Based around the Gregorian Calendar, most likely to be probability-basedDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) gain different powers based on the real-time date (TBD)#8th EntryCombat System: Based on the cardinal directions, most likely to be probability-basedDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) utilize different powers based on the location they are in, with their being 216 different locations distributed on a 6X6X6 grid (SOD)#9th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. Supposedly the character(s) enter different locations by going through 1 of 3 doors 5 times, resulting in 243 different results (CBD)#10th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: Most likely to have 2 characters, with one wielding a sword and the other a gun. Each one can imbue their weapon with 5 different catalysts, resulting in 120 different powers for each and a total of 240 (CBD)#11th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. There is a tree containing approx. 200 different fruits that the character(s) can come to and choose what they like, with each fruit having different results (SOD)#12th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. There is this parallel world with locations shrouded in darkness, that can only be uncovered with special catalysts in the main world. The specifics for this Discovery System is kind of tentative at the moment (SOD)#13th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: Amount of playable characters to be determined. The character(s) automatically collect objects whenever the player is inactive in real time (TBD)#14th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: Tentaive details at the moment, but there is a garden where special flowers can be grown, based on real time, that yield different effects once they're fully grown (TBD)#15th EntryCombat System: Undetermined as of nowDiscovery System: There is this city with approx. 200 different people, who are actually mystical beings in disguise. Using special catalysts, the player can choose who to use it on and reveal their true form, which will then assist the character(s) in battle (OBD)**|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||**I understand that just by looking at these short descriptions, it might be a bit hard to understand how these systems work in their entirety. So if you have any questions, feel free to ask.But most importantly, if you have any ideas regarding these 2 systems that you would like to share, I'd be happy to hear it.
 
Social Anxiety: The Game 
This is kinda stupid and I know it's kinda stupid, but it's an idea I've had for a long time and only tonight did I think to wander in here.The concept is basically a dating sim of sorts.  It starts out, you're having a conversation with a friend on the way to a bar or whatever.  Your responses to his sentences are in blocks that are kinda floating around the HUD, and you have to click on them to make that choice.When you get to the bar, a few girls (or guys or whatever) at the bar.  It's clear from the game design/GUI/HUD/etc that you're supposed to go talk to them.  But as you get closer, the game shakes slightly, blurs in places, lights get brighter or more glaring.  When you get close enough that dialogue options start floating, they're blurry, sometimes changing as they move, and some are moving pretty fast.  The closer you get, the more options appear, some of which are just nonsense, while others are sentences that are clearly bad choices (catcall type things).  The visuals continue to degrade.If you make it through this and start a conversation, things stabilize a lot but the dialogue options are still moving erratically, and regardless of the "relationship points" (obviously an invisible stat) they randomly get worse or more nonsensical, and more and more "I have to go" type options appear.It's a small concept, not really a "game" so much as an interactive movie I guess?  But maybe some development could build an actual story around it.  A branching thing with multiple possible outcomes.
 
A puzzle game where saving/loading/pausing only affects certain parts of it. 
So, for example, you could pause the game to suspend yourself in midair, or save and load to infinitely generate keys. Certain objects might have a little glow, to indicate that they aren't affected by the shenanigans.I'm thinking this would need to either be level-based with a lot of autosaves, or have "real" pausing and saving too, but the latter would probably make the in-game stuff feel awkward and unintuitive.The main inspiration for this was Braid, a game where you could rewind time, but some objects weren't affected by it.
 
A New Take On “Loot Based Gameplay” 
Instead of having a crap ton of duplicates filling up your inventory, or having a bogus ass ranking system where “Legendary” items are weaker then some Common items, why don’t we do this instead: every gear item is common! You get it once and that’s it, it’s in your inventory.But when you find a duplicate of that item, instead of hogging up your inventory it automatically upgrades the gear piece you already have! And ever one hundred levels (which would be really freaking easy to get to with so many duplicates), you can rank up that gear item to increase its rank, letting the *player* assemble a set of Legendary gear *through simply playing the game!*
 
Don’t Nap - A game in which you are a preschooler, it’s nap time, and you don’t want to take a nap. 
Had this idea because I work at a preschool and a rendition of this is played every day at nap time. I have no knowledge of game design, so I’m sorry if the flair is wrong. I’m guessing the AI would be really difficult to program.- 3D unity game- Stealth-focused gameplay. Similar to Slender or Baldi’s Basics.________________Concept/tagline: It’s nap time at the preschool you attend. But you don’t want to nap, you want to play! So you must sneak around and play with all the toys. But watch out, if the teacher catches you, you’re toast!____________________- objective: There are several different toys (blocks, matchbox cars, dolls, etc) laying around a classroom. You must “play” with all of them without being spotted by the teacher. In order to play with a toy, you walk up to it, press a button on your keyboard/controller, and a 2 second progress timer bar counts down. After this, you have officially “played” with that toy and can move onto the next one. After you’ve played with all the toys, you get a message saying that you’re sleepy, and you must return to your cot. Upon returning to the cot, you win the game.________________________- The teacher: the teacher patrols the classroom. They get more vigilant after every toy you play with. Starting out just reading a newspaper; and actively searching for you by the last toy. If the teacher sees you, they give chase, and they’re faster than you so escaping is possible but not recommended. If the teacher catches you once, they put you back in your cot, and go into the hardest mode for the remained of the game. If you get caught again, it’s game over.________________________- Your cot. You start the game on your nap time cot. If you are on your cot, you are safe, and if the teacher sees you on the cot, they will return to their desk temporarily. Once you’ve played with a few toys, of the teacher sees your cot empty, they will actively search for you instead of passively patrolling._________________- Other obstacles. There are a few other obstacles to avoid that will alert the teacher to your location. The teacher will go to the obstacle to investigate, so if you trigger one, it’s best to get away from that general area as quickly and quietly as possible.- Loose items. Loose items can be knocked over if you’re not careful. They will make a noise that draws the teacher to them.- Squeaky floorboards. There’s a subtle visual cue for which boards are squeaky. - Tattletales. Some of the other sleeping children will get woken up if you get too close to them, and will shout “teacherrrr!” This draws the teacher to the kid.- Paint bucket. This is a loose item that can be knocked over and alert the teacher. However, it can also be used to your advantage. When the teacher finds the paint spill on the floor, they will spend ten seconds or so cleaning the spill and ignore you. It’s placed somewhere in the classroom where there’s not much cover, though. So it’s a high risk, high reward strategy.__________- Getting around. You can either walk or crawl. Walking is faster but louder, crawling is slower but more stealthy.
 
An ambitious idea spawned from a dream 
I had an interesting dream last night that I think would make for a blockbuster of a game if done right and with enough resources.  The main premise is something along the lines of a trio party of demon slayers/hunters.  Each unique with a unique play style (hack and slasher/brawler/ranged/mage/gunner) and you can pick which one for a different story perspective.  But they are special in the sense that they all have additional visual modes (i.e. night vision, infrared, "demon vision/soul vision").  The visual modes will come into play for different areas of the game or with different enemies.  For example, some areas are dark or have some kind of visual limitation or stimulus that requires switching modes.  Some enemies are invisible or disguised as humans or things and the only tell is to switch visual modes.  You will be able to interact with NPC's with a fallout or mass effect style dialogue exchange.   Some of whom may be demons in disguise and the only tell would be to switch visual modes.  They could also change at points in the game (was human, now a demon in disguise or they were killed and replaced by a demon). You must always be on your guard and use your vision modes to ensure NPC's are innocent or trustworthy.  You may be attacked when you are exploring a town or wander from your party and must be constantly vigilant (as a demon hunter should be).  You may be in a crowded city and suddenly stabbed by a demon assassin disguised as a human only to be prevented by using your *demon/soul vision* to ensure that the area is safe.  You could also be exploring an area when an invisible demon attacks when you wouldn't expect it.On to combat.  I am envisioning something like devil may cry, a lock on style targeting system with gun play and combos.  Each character will have a style and skill tree to upgrade and unlock better skills/combos/perks/etc.  When allied are nearby, you can combo with them.  Ranged and gunners can use target lock on close enemies or free aim for targets out of range.  But i also like the idea of being able to switch between 3rd and 1st person perspectives.  Difficulty would have two elements.   The base game would have your health/damage buffs of course, easier modes giving you more damage resistance and such so you can breeze through soaking up damage just to enjoy the story.  With the harder modes would reduce your health or make you take damage.  One thing i cannot stand is harder difficulties just buffing enemies.  I still want to be able to kill fodder efficiently, otherwise it's a slog.  The second element would be whether you use your vision effectively or not.  Say you speak to an npc and they send you to an area to save a person.  You get there and suddenly you are attacked.  The npc was a demon in disguise and you didn't vet them.  Or you work with an npc you worked with suddenly becomes a demon and when you have your back turned, they try to kill you because you assumed they would always be human.I also think this game would benefit from a permadeath mode.  Say you fail to thwart an assassination attempt or you fail to rescue a party member who was kidnapped.  Well you/they are dead. But your party must continue on without the missing member.  The game would have different endings/mission branches depending on who died and when it happened.The goal is to be a fun hack and slash style game with crazy demons who could attack you at any moment.  Npcs can't always be trusted, so there is an added layer of paranoia the game should instill on you.  You shouldn't trust your eyes alone but should trust in your *special* eyes.  The game should have you constantly on guard against enemies and strangers alike.Tl;dr: devil may cry style combo beatem up but with metroid prime visual modes. 3 party members(demon hunters) and Fallout npc interaction, some of whom can be demons in disguise.  Don't trust that anyone is human as they can be disguised or mislead you.  Not souls like hard unless you make it that way.  Permadeath options.
 
Everything that you touch will rot 
This is the Anti-Midas story: A puzzle game about being dealt the most rotten hand by life, but striving to become a hero instead of succumbing to fate.&#x200B;At the start of the game, you are cursed by a wizard for being a dick. He says you are to never feel human touch again. Now you’re walking in the forest; the ground around your feet becomes grey and lifeless, cracking apart as you walk on them. Famished, you try to pick up fruits to eat, but they rot. You faint from the hunger. You wake up to see a kind old woman who generously feeds you. She gives you a pair of magic gloves, which helps you hold things. You can now toggle between gloved and bare hands. The woman tells you to rest at her cottage before it’s dark. That night, you wake up to her screams, and find bandits looting the place. They kill the old woman. You lunge at them.&#x200B;Your goal in the game is to avenge your savior, and find the wizard in order to force him to resurrect her. You gain temporary items like boots, helmet and weapons which slowly fall apart. Combat is simple, you try to touch the opponent before their weapon reaches you (I think VR is good for this kind of combat). You can also fight using your wit, for example touching the rope on a hanging bridge to make it fall. The game will also focus on story-based puzzles, like making a tree rot and fall over to get across obstacles, or poisoning people with your virus.
 
Phone Flipping Game 
Imagine a game in wich you can use your phone's gyroscope to do phone Flipping tricks combo's and so on.I bet alot of people will drop their phones onto the floor LoL
 
A horror game in which the monster is just standing there. Menacingly. 
In most horror games, the terror comes from not knowing when you'll run into the big bad monster(s). But in this one, the monsters are plainly visible, and the real terror comes from not knowing when they are going to aggro.This concept is the [gibdo in Ocarina of Time](https://www.piranhazone.com/images/zelda/ocarina/p64/en033_1.jpg) fleshed out into a full horror game.*What* aggros the monster(s) is made purposefully obtuse, so the player can never tell if they'll be safe the next time they have to sneak past.The concept is flexible enough to vary the setpieces throughout a whole game. Maybe it starts off as one monster in the middle of a room you have to constantly travel through. Another time the game forces you to sneak past it while carrying something loud trying to not bump into obstacles. Later, you return to the room *and it's not there!* Where did it go? Shit, now it's in a tight hallway!Later in the game, there's forty of them lined up in rows [like stone soldiers](https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/989/515/56733_1_1280x720_640x360_177576003886.jpg) and you know at least one of them is real.##### BONUS IDEANormally I'd save this idea for a future post... but it fits the above idea so well that I have to put it here:Normally you can outrun the monster easily. But if the monster is in your field of view when it aggros, it forces you to look at it. The camera snaps and locks on the monster as its body contorts and shuffles toward you. Since you can't run backwards, you're forced to *walk* back, and it's slowly gaining on you. Even worse, since you can't see behind you, you'll have to navigate by memory so you don't get stuck or snagged on the map. After a while, the camera unlocks and you can run proper.
 
Thanks u/HamsterIV for further elaborating on my idea for a tank crew simulator game. 
Tank Crew SimulatorIntroTank Crew simulator will be a multiplayer cooperative game where 1 or 4 players operate the various stations of a tank. The game will be simple enough to play on a tablet or phone. The four roles will be commander, driver, gunner, and engineer. Game modes will allow for 1 team completing a series of objectives against the environment or 2 teams fighting each other in a defined battle area.UIAll players will have a UI that includes a 360 degree compass for both world orientation and local vehicle orientation. A tab bar across the top will allow the player to see all the tank roles and if another player is occupying oneThe Commander gets a 3rd person view of the game but no inputs that will affect the tank. They can zoom in and out. Their main job will be to relay turret coordinates to the gunner and driving coordinates to the driver. They also get to see the heat sensor array on the tank similar to the engineer. The commander will be able to access the world map and set a waypoint on it to assist the driver and gunner with destinationThe Engineer controls power distribution between the tracks and the turret. This will determine how fast the tank drives and turns. As well as how fast the turret turns and elivates. It will be desirable for lower power settings to be set for fine adjustments and higher power for gross movement. The engineer's main interface is a triangular touch pad that routes power between tracks, turret, and idle. The engineer will also have a series of toggles for things like smoke generators, and fire extinguishers.The Gunner will have four buttons that adjust the orientation of the turret, the rotation speed will depend on the engineer’s power setting. There will be a loading progress indicator as well as an indicator of what round is loaded. The gunner can load different rounds by clicking on the shot locker grid. The gunner will have a limited view of the outside world through a small port hole and a zoom slider. This view will line up with the cannon and allow for small adjustments.The driver will have two sliders to control the power going to each track. The driver can apply this power in full forward, half forward, idle, half back, and full back. The driver will be able to see out the forward vector of the tank. The movement of the tracks will be determined by the power the engineer funnels to the track transmission.Game mechanicsThis game will take place in a defined arena space. The tank will have a shot locker of 16 shells and there will be a staging point where the tank can restock. The shell types will be:High explosive - does damage in an area with a moderate damage bonus for direct hitsArmor piercing - does massive damage with a direct hit, but no splash damage, limited ability to shoot through buildings.Smoke - simulates a tank’s smoke generating ability only at longer rangeThe tank will traverse the game world via the unity physician engine applying forward and backwards energy to the rigid body at the point of track contact with the ground. Because the tank will not always rest on level ground the tank commander will have pips to indicate the turret turn and elevation  necessary to generate a shot at the center point of the commander’s screen.Hydraulic Energy distribution will be an important aspect for both vehicle control and turret control. The turret will turn faster when more energy is sent to the turret but this may be undesirable when making fine changes. Likewise the driver will experience a similar game mechanic with the speed of the treds.Tank death occurs when the shotlocker overheats and its internal fuel and ammo supply explodes. Various components over the tank can take damage and start overhearing. If left unchecked the overheat can spread to the shot locker and explode. The engineer has control over the coolant system that will counter this overheat effect. There is a limited supply of coolant  (restockable at the staging point) if the coolant runs out and the tank is still damaged it will eventually explode. If there is an active damage situation the engineering station will be highlighted.The driver and turret roles have state buttons that determine how fast the tank is moving or turret spinning. These states drop to 0 if a player transfers away from the role. For example if there is only one player and they are in the driver role driving full speed ahead. Should that player swap to the gunner role the driver station will automatically zero out the drivetrains and the tank will come to a halt.The engineer can generate a smoke screen from the tanks engines and the gunner can place smoke rounds, these actions will create vision obscuring smoke that lingers for a while and obscures vision. For AI purposes smoke colliders will be placed 1000 units up from the smoke cloud and any tank spotting must be done at ground level and at the 1000 unit up level to ensure the AI can’t cheat and see through the smoke.Some levels will feature airstrikes, where enemy or allied air power will swoop in and straif the crap out of a tank. The players will have advance notice of an oncoming airstrike and have the chance to get under cover, either in a wood, under smoke or under a building. In vs multi player games the teams will alternate airstrikes.Some levels will feature AI infantry and static anti tank guns. These will be scripted into the scenario and provide additional challenges and targets for the player.Scenarios:Co-op LevelsTraining - Provides a course and instruction on how to navigate, drive, aim and repair the tank. Various stations around a simulated village will give the playerSpeed Run - same layout as the training level except there will be no prompts, a timer will count down how long it takes the players to drive from point a to point b while engaging various targets at range.Convoy ambush - Attack a convoy of trucks making their way through a winding forest road. Drive through the forest to  get ahead of the convoy before it flees to safety.Town Siege - lay down coving fire and smoke screens to help allied forces assault a town. Move between hills around the town to get optimal firing angles.Town Assault - drive your tank through a town engaging enemy infantry and anti tank guns at point blank range.Bunker Complex Assault - drive your tank through a bunker complex nestled in a hilly woodland. Infantry and anti tank guns are hidden in randomly placed bunkers.Airport Assault -  Secure an airport and destroy evacuation transports. Enemy infantry and anti tank guns may be hidden amid the buildings. Enemy airstrikes are a threatVS LevelsRolling hills - rolling hills dominate a river valley, tree cover can be found next to the river and in sparse pockets between the hills. Good for long range tank dules. Alternating airstrikes are an option.Town - copy of the town map only with no AI forces running around. Narrow streets and destroyable buildings should result in very close range action. Alternating airstrikes are an option.Bunker complex - same as the bunker complex woodland. Low visibility due to fog forces players to engage at close range. Too cloudy and wooded for airstrikes.Airport - Same as the airport assaut, large buildings are good for hiding from air strikes. The open runway area in the middle is good for long range duels. Alternating airstrikes are an option.  Thank you for reading and feel free to give suggestions.
 
A VR game that isnt VR. Instead, each eye sees the world in the past and present. 
So you know how the VR works by presenting the same world rendered a few inches to the left and right in order to mimic the human eyes capability for producing 3d vision. While, how about instead of using the screens for that purpose, we allow two separate images at the same time in different times or locations, and the game is played by closing each eye and comparing the worlds to each other in order to discover things and solve puzzles.For instance, closing your left eye would give you a clear picture of the room youre in, with a locked door, and then closing your right eye would reveal that there used to be a lever to the left of the door which has since been covered up. The story would be something along the lines of, your left eye has been endowed with magic allowing you to see the past.
 
A game about fighting a coma in your mind. 
So, this is a pretty flexible concept, I just have the bare minimum right now, essentially it’d be a single player story/puzzle game where you play as the imagination “avatar” of a patient in a hospital exploring their imagination, solving puzzles to remember who they are and what happened to them. Each level you could collect a different part of yourself to piece together the patient’s memories and find a different piece in a different world, like their creativity in a fantasy realm, their anger in a hell-like area, or their relationships in a school. It might not need to be so literal though, as u/garbitos_x86 said, maybe make is a little more abstract or detached, maybe there could be a “hub” as a menu that you can explore with a little bit more abstract kind of feelAt the end, if you find all your pieces, you wake up with no memories of the journey you went through, leaving the player with a bittersweet moment of “they will never remember what I went through and what I did, but they’ll be able to make new connections.” Any thoughts?Edit: thinking about this, I think there’s a horror game about someone fighting their way geth rough their depression, and i forgot the name, but it could be a little like that.
 
Why aren’t there any Giant Monster Battling Games? 
I am on the new side of developing video games, but one idea that has been stuck in my head is an updated monster fighting game. Think about the 2004 “Godzilla: Save the Earth” or even the 2003 “War of the Monsters” but 2021 edition. I am not entirely sure if there is just not a big enough audience for these types of games or if these types of games were just left in the 2000s for no particular reason. I feel if the combat is done right, and the environment truly is responsive to the massive fight taking place this game can not only be a fun and immersive game to play with friends, but could even include versions of ranked play for the more competitive. What’s great about big monster battling games is no one really cares about the story. For example, look at the new King Kong versus Godzilla movie. People (myself included) didn’t care much for the story telling (and let’s be real it was was not that great), but rather they just wanted to see two huge monsters clash it out on the big screen. It would be no different with a video game. You could even incorporate multiple game modes 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, free-for-all, and the list goes on. Obviously this is more of a question than an idea, but let me know what y’all think and if this would be something you would consider playing. Feel free to even give me ideas, because I would love for this idea to be my first big game project I attempt to create. Thanks!EDIT: I didn’t realize this post would even get this much attention! Thank you all for the tips, advice, and information. Like I said I am very new to the game developing world, and I have a full time job. Game development is only a hobby of mine, a project this big will take me a LONG TIME. So if there are any indie developers that would want to take on this project dm me!
 
Tower defence game where you are a moving power source. 
You are a mobile power source. Turrets withing a range near you get power and turn of when you leave. You may also only build turrets near you.To make things interesting, you can have stationary batteries that charge up when you are nearby. They will continue to deliver power to nearby turrets until they themselves run out of charge.

A Modern "The Movies" (2005) is an Absolute No Brainer for any Company with Strategy Game Expertise, and Here's Why 
**The What**The Movies, released in 2005 by the now defunct Lionhead Games, was a game that essentially allowed the user to create their own short films with an astonishingly customizable host of sets, scenes, costumes, and effects. The career mode took you through the 1920s up to the 2000s, allowing you to discover new movie making techniques, sets, and costumes along the way.**The Why*** The gaming industry has an increasingly insatiable hunger for never-ending customization, uploading and sharing; it started with user pictures from games (which is now a key feature in many modern games), but we're seeing it in new ways, like *Dreams*, *Animal Crossing*, and the wonderful ways *Cyberpunk 2077* has incorporated customization into their character creator.  *Fallout: New Vegas* , a game in which you choose your path, has become a cult classic.  Freedom is what the people want in their games.* In 2005, a French industrial designer named Alex Chan created a 13 minute movie using *The Movies* creator, titled,*The French Democracy*.  It took him four days, and conveyed his view on riots and civil unrest at that time in France.  It received widespread, unprecedented attention from entities such as *Businessweek*, *The Washington Post*, and Peter Molyneux himself.  In the age of social media, an updated, polished, expanded game that allowed users to do this would produce masterpieces, and I'm not exaggerating.  *The Movies* was made in 2005, the possibilities after fifteen years of innovation are truly endless.* It makes business sense. The management sect of gaming is alive and well.  From a studio like *Paradox* , the game would sell.  On top of this, the DLC options are endless.  Look at *Planet Coaster* and their *Back to the Future* DLC.  In theory, a company could make DLC for as many movies as they wanted, granted they get the rights. * Last, but not least: if it's moddable, it is OVER. If a feature was implemented that allowed users to create and share their own custom made scenes, costumes, or effects, a single person could make a film that rivals a 1970s cartoon Disney Movies. With the creativity and dedication of the modding community, ANYTHING would be possible.I genuinely think giving people an engine to express their creativity like this would be revolutionary.  You see it on the front page of Reddit from time to time; a dedicated coder making their own game that looks great.  Imagine this, but with short films.  The game released in 2005 was already more customizable than it had any right to be; after fifteen years, the right studio could monopolize this market. Hope someone sees this, love the original and wanted to get my ideas out there! Any critiques are welcomed!
 
Co-Op open world Sims 4 like game. 
A game like sims 4, where you can have kids, manage your estate, get married etc, but it’s open world, you can play with your friends, live with them/roommate etc. Go to their restaurants etc. Something similar the idea it would remind me of, is “Fiesta” from back in the day.
 
A VR game in which you keep putting on more "VR headsets" deeper into increasingly abstracted virtual worlds (Inception-style). 
The game starts in the first "layer" in a realistic looking room with a human NPC playing some cool VR game. They take off their VR headset, hand it to you and insist you try out the game. Once you put it on you enter the game's second "layer".Each time you put on another headset, the world you enter is more abstracted/surreal and the gameplay is more fun.The first layer was a mostly boring room with a few things to interact with, while several layers down you're trying to fix a spaceship by entering its mainframe through a VR device, and yet even further down you're fighting a polygonal cyberdragon to reach the magical knight's cyber-helmet to go yet another layer deeper. Once you beat the game, you start taking off the helmets one by one until you reach the real world.What's the point?Everybody has at some point wondered if their whole world is just some TV show or movie. Something like The Truman Show. But since the shows/movies we watch are way more exciting than real life, *it must mean that whoever is watching your life must live in an even more boring world than yours.*The game would be about planting that showerthought in the player's head without explicitly saying it. "Every layer down is more interesting and succinct, so a layer up from real life would be way more boring and uneventful.
 
the man who has an incredibly low stamina, a puzzle game 
so this game is about you guessed it, a man with low stamina, so low in fact, he can barely get to his front lawn without assistance, so he needs to find ways to recover his stamina through his daily routine. from breakfast to coffee to drinking from a fire hydrant, there are many ways he can recover his stamina. this game will take a little inspiration from manual Samuel but be more puzzle based. trying to find ways to recover stamina so you can get through the day is the main stchick, and uhm, thats it i guess, i'm bad at ending things :p
 
Reverse Post 
Hi guys! I'm in a bit of a predicament. Unlike most posts on this sub that have an idea and no game, I actually have a game and no ideas! I have implemented many of the things I wanted in my game but I don't feel like its enough content. Therefor, here is your opportunity to bounce some ideas off me and maybe have them implemented. Here's the game so far.You control a colony of ants, managing their actions. You unlock different tiers of buildings, and I research tree governs how and when you unlock things. You need to gather resources and put your ants into different buildings to research new things, breed more ants, forge new items, or produce new foods. There are currently three tiers of buildings/rooms, each one getting progressively more difficult to set up and produce. However, I have run out of ideas for cool mechanics or ideas that make the game worth playing longer term. If this was a game that you were playing, what would be a super cool end game goal? What would make you keep playing and prevent the "get resources and build stuff" loop less boring? Also, if you have any ideas that you think would be really cool, let me know and I'll see what I think.Some gameplay and reference footage can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/kyovwv/the_pathfinding_of_your_ants_make_some_crazy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).&#x200B;Edit: Alright I just got back so lemme try and respond to all of you :) Also, for any new readers, please read some of the comments because there's some more info in there.
 
Slashers-A New Spin On Battle Royal 
So I’ve had an idea kicking around in my head for a few days now, a new spin on the Battle Royale genre. I am calling it Slashers!Picture this, you and the boys are queuing up to play Slashers. 80 Players are in the lobby and your ready to play your first match. Where ya dropping? Not up to you, you spawn in at a random location. You and the boys grab weapons in the first person and start going after the other 72 players in an attempt to achieve victory!Except you realize that there is no storm, and that there are only 76 players on the map. Where are the other four players? You ask this question just as your ambushed by a chainsaw wielding undead lumberjack who cannot be killed and proceeds to put your whole squad in the ground.This is the major difference Slashers brings to the BR formula. Instead of a storm, four players are randomly selected to become Slashers, unkillable horror villains who can warp around the map and use special abilities and gadgets to hunt down Survivors. And as a survivor, you’ll have to use stealth and wits to outmaneuver both your opponents *and* the Slashers hunting for you.It’s PUBG meets Apex Legends meets Dead By Daylight. Do your best to survive, and remember that there is no storm. *only Slashers!*
 
An urban climbing game 
A VR game that allows you go climb construction sights, buildings and even stadiums who doesn't want to climb the Effiel Tower? The games allow the player  to find a way up to the to top. It allows the player to freely choose a way to the top but some wrong moves can potentially cause the player's character to fall off and have to climb all over again.
 
Sandbox game where you build a fort out of household furniture like chairs, pillows, tables, sheets, etc. and see how well it holds up against monsters. 
Simple idea I came up with, inspired by the "forts" my little sister likes to build.
 
A videogame which seems like a kiddy adventure game, as long as you follow the linear path the story has set you. The more you deviate from the main storyline path, the more unsettling, creepy, and horrific the game gets. 
 
Purge BR? 
So I was watching the Purge, after playing Warzone, and thought, “What if there was a Purge themed Battle Royale? I know I may not be the only person to come up with this idea, but I would like to bring something to the table.Okay, so for player customization, there could be cosmetics you could buy using in game currency by surviving the Purge, robbing banks and places cash would be (you’ll get it in a minute), and here’s the catch, you have to survive the Purge to keep anything you loot during the Purge. You could get preorder cosmetics, maybe like the Smileys from the first movie or from the First Purge. You could buy, loot, or find plans for more cosmetics in a store sort of system.You can buy guns that are base, with no attachments, and find attachments in the map. Stuff you find can be kept if you survive the Purge, including attachments. If you have more attachments than a gun can have, then a customization menu can be used to add different attachments. Next is the map. It could be a medium sized map, with different districts, such as a hills suburbia sort of place, a poorer district, and a city sort of area, each place could have a different amount of loot, with the City having the most, and poorer having less. The City could have sub-districts, such as a bank area for the players who just want money, to use in the for mentioned cosmetic shop, a self defense district for players that would like to purge their fellow players or defend themselves, along with a hospital to scavenge meds.for players that don’t want a huge map, there could be the island from the First Purge movie.Next up is functionality of the game. Unlike other Battle Royales,there wouldn’t be a wall of imminent death, but players would be driven to purge other players in a hunger games esqu senerio, where they can make groups with other players, or play with friends, but either way, you could purge everyone, and either be the last one standing like a normal br, or you could simply try to survive the whole match, which would last about thirty minutes. Players would start off with their friends if they had a pre-made group, in a set location, and move on from there.This was how I think it should go if we get a Purge themed BR. All opinions are accepted.
 
Reach the surface 
It would be really cool to see a game a bit like subnautica and space engineers where you're stuck at the bottom of an ocean in some diving bell bunker thing, and have to reach the surface by extending lines from your oxygen and power generator. It could have a seasons mechanic where different fish come araund at different seasons. Maybe some whales during a part of their migration. Another intresting part would be that during winter the top of the water froze, so you had to wait until it melted or you could mine through straight to the top.Hope i was understandable and sorry for any spelling problems, cause english is not my first language.
 
Horror game where it's up to you to keep things scary 
Basically the idea is that you are the monster or bad entity in a horror game scenario and the "protagonist" is controlled by an AI.Your goal is to create a genuine and enjoyable horror experience for this AI by scaring it via atmosphere, jumpscares or anything you can come up with. But like any other horror game, doing the same jumpscare over and over will most likely bore the player and he will quit the game or won't get scared anymore. It also gets progressively harder to scare the AI.This is where your "healthbar" comes in. You have a "Hunger Meter" which you fill by scaring the player. The scarier you are the more you fill up the bar. However, repeating certain actions or by just being not scary enough, the player won't get as scare anymore and your hunger bar will slowly drain which will lead to game over.Also a cool mechanic I thought was giving the monster more and more ways to scare the AI by progressing the story.Now the thing is I have no idea how you can make this concept in to an actual game. I think it's very applyable to any sort of game but i can't really visualize a scenery for it.
 
A 10 v 10 FPS except you do not know who is on you’re team. There are no gamertags, no skins, nothing to differentiate players other than communication. Friendly fire? On. 
The idea is that it is a small map with 20 players. 10 players on red team and the other 10 on blue. There is no teamchat, meaning that you  can’t privately tell your team who you are. If you run into another player, you can lie and say you’re part of the opposite team, you can agree to carry on with your day, or obliterate anyone you see. If you kill a teammate you will be eliminated from play unless you have already killed an enemy. Killing an enemy gives you an extra life that prevents you from facing the teamkill penalty (only once!). The last team standing/team with the most amount of players win.
 
Harry Potter tripple A game 
Why hasn't any company made a full send Harry Potter game.It would be cool to have a Harry Potter game with today's graphics, and game design. You could play as a new wizard before or after the Harry Potter events on the timeline.It doesn't have to be open world, but you could be free to roam around hogwarts, grounds. I imagine something similar to God of War, where it's not a HUGE map, but you're free to go anywhere you can. There's an infinite amount of ways to go about making a game like this, but I think this would be a cool idea, and if done right, would be a huge hit among gamers and Harry Potter fans alike.
 
My ideal video game would be survival horror that slowly turns into a dating sim because the monsters think I'm cute >w< 
 
A game where you play as a smart home system interacting with things connected to you to kill the people living in the house. 
For example. You turn on the water in the kitchen and distract everyone to not turn off the water. Eventually you flood the kitchen floor making it slippery. You then make the phone in the kitchen ring. The tenant runs to answer it, slips on the water, and breaks his neck.Each level is a new house and new tenants each with unique behaviors and routines.
 
Shoplifting in VR. The focus is on stealing things right under NPCs' noses. 
Robbing a shop owner blind in Skyrim [by putting a bucket on his head](https://youtu.be/PBbGxEb6YrA?t=78) has always been kind of funny to me. This VR game would try to recreate that sensation of stealing right in front of the NPC with methods that have no business working in real life, while retaining the thrill of a stealth game.In this game, all you have to do is pinch items in the short windows of time that the NPC is looking away (or multiple NPCs in harder stages). While they aren't looking, you simply grab an object and hold it to your chest to tuck it into your shirt. As you steal, the growing bulge in your sweater becomes glaringly obvious you've stolen to anyone smarter than a sour lemon... but not to these NPCs.Larger objects take longer to stuff into your shirt, so you have to find clever inconveniences to distract the NPCs for longer. You'll often rearrange their stuff so they have to painstakingly put them back in order. The room has several Rube Goldberg Machine setups to inconvenience the NPCs in various ways, much like how *Untitled Goose Game* does it. So you might need to get the NPC to accidentally mace himself with bear spray to blind him long enough to steal his ice-cream machine.You have a checklist of things you MUST steal, and those often require clever problem solving. For example, you might be tasked with stealing the shirt off of the NPCs back, so one step involves "accidentally" spilling some red wine on it so the NPC takes off his shirt. While the NPC is pulling his shirt up over his head, you might use that time efficiently to pocket some more of his stuff.
 
Cthulhu meets Battle royale 
All current Battle Royales seem to be rather light hearted. WHat if there was an Battle royale where everything is dark and gloomy. You don't find weapons but pages of the necronomicon. Reading them activates the some effect, replacing the arm with tentacles, teaching the reader a spell, summons a demon(hopefully a sacrifice is nearby.) Just an outlandish game idea.

A horror game that slowly morphs into a non-horror game through repeated play. 
Resident Evil 4 was my first "horror" game and it was scary the first time I played it. But the more I played and replayed it, the more I turned into *Leon: Destroyer of Plagas*.This game idea is a condensed and exaggerated version of this concept. It's designed to go from "P.T. scary" to "Serious Sam empowering."However, the game is still the same game the whole way through... it's only the player who changes.### HOW IT WORKSThe game takes place in a large haunted labyrinth. Every time you start the game, you're spawned in a different area of the same world. This is done so that each playthrough feels unfamiliar at first, but after repeated play you know the game map like the back of your hand.At first there appears to be *one* supernatural monster that can spawn anywhere, do anything and kill you at any time (picture the crying woman from P.T.). However, through repeated play you realize there's actually several of them and they all each have their own unique patterns and predictable behaviors. They're meant to look similar (but not identical) so that they seem like one unpredictable monster at first.Lastly and most importantly, the game starts out without a clear objective. You don't know where to go and what you're supposed to do. Your first playthroughs are about unraveling the mystery. Through environmental storytelling, you learn that you're here to eliminate the supernatural entities. You're some kind of professional exorcist.**Not only that, but you've had the ability to kill the demons all along.** The game just didn't make it explicit.To eliminate demons, *you have to let them hurt you.* Like S.O.M.A. and many other horror games, you can take one "hit" from a monster. You drop to the floor, your vision gets blurry, you hear voices and see visions, and you're forced to limp in pain. Also like typical horror games, there are "health points" on the map that recover you to full health.Well it turns out that when you're "hit" by a demon you're actually being possessed and your character is resisting. This is why he is limping, seeing visions and hearing voices. And those "health points" are actually special exorcism tomes. When you use it, you're actually eliminating the demon that resided in you. Now you just have to do it with the remaining demons.The game mechanics are obfuscated. Sometimes the monsters kill you instead of damaging you, but it isn't clear why. You later learn that you died because you're facing away from the demon when it caught you. At least for some of them. For others you might have to weaken them by luring them to special areas.### WHY IT WORKSAs gamers, we've been taught to run & hide from monsters in horror games if we don't have weapons. The game lets the player do this in typical horror game fashion, but it doesn't teach or tell him to do this. It's only after the player turns to face his demons that he'll realize they can be overcome. It's the central theme of the game, in fact.By the time you've beaten it, it'll be an empowering game. You'll no longer need to run around uncovering the mystery. Instead, you'll be running around to beat your previous record. By the end, you'll feel like the monsters should be running from *you.*
 
I’ve seen people wanting a Simpsons Hit&Run remake. I would love a Futurama open-world adventure instead 
I am new and a non-native English speaker so I am sorry if there’s problems with my post. If this game somehow exists already then forgive my blatant ignorance.I’m just daydreaming, hence the flair.Okay, here goes...I’m thinking a RPG/sandbox game set in the Futurama universe with the cartoony graphics like we got in Hit&Run way back when (obviously improved). It would initially be set in New New York, with opportunities to travel to other planets (like in Outer Worlds).- I don’t have a specific main quest line in mind, but would be cool roleplaying as a new member of Planet Express, traveling the universe with Fry, Leela, Bender & co. doing deliveries and getting into problems.- Possible antagonists: Nixon, Robot Devil, MOM, Lrrrr.- Side quests could introduce the protagonist to other famous characters, like Calculon, Elzar, Flexo, the construction worker who only speaks plural, to name a few...- Character creation would let you mix a lot of different species and robots we see in the TV show to add to the already diverse personalities of the delivery crew. - Body modification for sure- I consider Futurama to be a show mostly for adults, so features like partying, gambling, sex, alcoholism and drug use could be implemented. Some violence as well with all that future tech. I mean, there’s suicide booths... All this would also make a world with some depth, not just an empty shell.Obvious problems: copyrights and voice actors.Appreciate all kinds of feedback.
 
Story, mechanics, and what your idea actually is 
I see a lot of people post ideas to this sub and seem to have a weird idea about how to go about combining their story with their mechanics. Often they have trouble identifying what even separates the two. Here's a couple of examples (quality of examples not in focus here);First example:Idea maker - "I have this awesome idea for a racing game where the levels are designed to slowly funnel the player into death traps they have to avoid but they are encouraged to move toward this danger and rewarded for doing so but punished for getting too greedy, the closer to the edge you get the faster you go, fall into a trap and be punished severely. The player is doing this because one day he wakes up and sees that some aliens are trying to kidnap the towns folk and everyone is running for their lives."In this example I just made up the person with this idea has a decent idea for the mechanics for a game and seemingly shoehorned in a story. There's no reason to worry about a story when you obviously have some decent ideas for mechanics in play already. Don't tackle so much when you have so little done. Your story is completely worthless without good game play.Second example:Idea maker - "So the main character is living a fantastic life in a great world. Everything is peaceful until one day the most beautiful woman in the land is kidnapped, and an evil sorcerer is planning to sacrifice her to destroy the country and take over the world. He is reluctant at first because he's just a simple man living his life, but soon an angel falls from the sky, struck down by the evil magic from the sorcerer. This angel happens to land in the village of the main character and in the angels dying breath gives the character a magical ability to make contact with heaven so they can send aid in time. At first the character refuses, why should he risk his life for such a journey? But eventually he realizes that without doing this the world may crumble, his family die, and the beautiful woman he has sought after sacrificed. As he leaves his town, his best friend, a doctor, accompanies him. Throughout the journey the doctor will save the life of the character multiple times and will serve as a connection to the world through moral ambiguity showing that the choices of the player has an impact on others eventually near the end the player will be forced to choose between saving his friend, or saving this woman and the world. This should be an RTS with a human faction, a sorcerer faction, and a neutral faction that sometimes interferes with the players work.In this example the person with this idea I just made up had a solid start to a story, following the concept of the Heros Journey very well. This would likely be great for a JRPG, instead for some reason they are focused in on the idea that this should be an RTS for some reason. How will the game play mechanics even help support such a story?Another example that can happen with example two on occasion is; "This will play just like \*\*insert game\*\*" Remember, when a game is created if it's too similar in game play to another game it will usually be overshadowed by that game (if that game was successful which most of the time the person writing it will choose the most successful example they can think of). If you have a great story idea, that's your idea. Don't worry about trying to figure out what kind of game play mechanics it should have just yet.This post isn't to say that you can't have well fleshed out mechanics and story already, but if you aren't confident with one or the other don't worry about it. Good stories can find homes in good mechanics whether it's someone else helping you or you just give up the story idea to whomever wants to run with it. Same with mechanics, the cool mechanics can be used or a story figured out later, just focus on what makes your mechanics different than other games.
 
GAME IDEA TEMPLATE 
For some background, I'm an intermediate indie game developer who would like to see this sub grow. I know what it takes to make and pitch a game, and find most idea posts on this sub are missing the mark. Use the below template to ensure your idea can be translated into a game.       There is a TLDR copy/paste version at the bottom.            ----------  [TITLE] A one-sentence overview of what your game is all about. Ex: 'The player is a cat, hunting a mouse that lives in the walls.'[BODY]  **Name** (Your best idea for what the game should be called): 'Whiskers'   **Main Mechanic** (what the player will be spending most of the time doing): 'The player sneaks around the house, deducing the mouse's current hiding place through visual sound waves and scratching noises. When the mouse makes a break for the food, the player does everything they can to catch the mouse.'  **Side Mechanics** (secondary features to make the game more fun): 'Stealth and acrobatic movement, using the terrain such as couches and kitchen chairs to get around faster. Multiple mice on harder levels.'  **Story** (The main story idea if your game has one): 'The cat is left alone at the house, and must protect the food under a time limit until the owners get home.'   **Similar to** (games or references that your game relates to for added clarity, usually a 1-sentence pitch): 'Whack-a-Mole meets Assassin's Creed.'  **Advanced Features** (Features that could be added in if made by a strong enough team, but are not needed for the game to function): 'Mouse mode, where the player plays the same level but as the mouse instead of the cat. Multiplayer mode, with 1-2 cats and 2-4 mice. Co-Op mode with 2 cats or 2 mice, etc. Level design mode. Outside mode.'     ----------  While some of this stuff might seem extra, this information is really important for sharing something as complex as a game idea. It gives someone a foundation from which to build game mechanics, come up with a story and visual style, without becoming lost or confused by your idea.  If sharing a game idea with someone feels like you are telling them about a vague dream, then you probably need to think about your idea a little bit more before sharing.  TL;DR / COPY AND PASTE FORMAT **NAME:**   **MAIN MECHANIC:**  **SIDE MECHANICS:**   **STORY:**    **SIMILAR TO:**  **ADVANCED FEATURES:**
 
The exorcist a game about you trying to save possessed people 
Hello, I've had this game idea for a while now. In the game you play as a exorcist who's job it is to cleanse possessed people. My idea is that every possessed person is possessed by a demon who are categorised in different difficulty levels. Each difficulty level is slightly harder then the last one.Before you begin cleansing people you first get a mail about the possessed person and the amount of information that you get about that person depends on what kind of demon/difficulty level you get. After the mail you can buy stuff in a shop that can help cleanse this demon and every demon/difficulty level need different items then other demons. After that you start the process of cleansing the possessed person. I haven't really thought out yet what I want the game mechanics to look like or what they should do. But when your successful in cleansing the possessed person you get a amount of money depending on what demon/difficulty level the possessed person is. This is the basic idea of the game. Please give me feedback so I can improve the idea or switch too something completely different.
 
VR "Where's waldo" esque game where you are given a description and must move through a crowd and find the person 
Different factors would limit how easy it is to find him, like loud noises, flahsing lights, disguise. Maybe you would need to check id on them

A game similar to Stardew Valley, that turns out to be dark 
At the start of the game, you choose your gender and appearence. Then, a cutscene explains why did you move to a small town.Basically, you have to work to get money for updates in your home, for clothes, etc.You can't farm, but you can get a girlfriend/boyfriend. One of the boyfriends always sits on a fountain to read.The game also has some special events and your choices affect the game, so it would be very replayable.But things start to turn dark. Supposedly the town has 50 habitants, but we can only see 49. When you hang out with the boyfriend at the fountain, other habitants will ask you "why do you spend so much time sitting alone in that fountain". People will knock at your door but nobody will be outside. Lights will start to flicker, etc.This will continue to get worse to the point you get to talk about it to one of the habitants, who will tell you to go to a medic, where you end up being diagnosed with schizophrenia. The medic will give you only a few pills, as they are expensive. The pills "deactivate" the effects of the schizophrenia. The problem is that is hard to tell if the effects are activated or not (because the colors and the art style remains the same, only some tiny details look odd), so you have to choose wisely whenever is needed to take a pill or not. The game continues with the events and everything, but with that dark side. Later in the game, for example, you find out that the boyfriend at the fountain doesn't exist, and he was created by the schizophrenia, showing a cutscene where the protagonist starts to cry. Then, our new objective is to discover all the secrets of that town, as nobody is who seems to be...
 
Daredevil game where you are blind... hear me out.... 
I saw this as a joke post of someone posting a black screen and saying it was a daredevil game, but actually I think you could make it an interesting mechanic.&#x200B;I envisage kind of a first person fighting game, but with a focus on parkour style movement.  The catch would be that it would be wireframed/flashed images and you would have a difficulty setting that would alter the ratio of black screen to flash of image.  So you have to remember where things are laid out and jump based on judging rather than in direct feedback to screen cues.&#x200B;It is also possible you could go with a cane tap mechanic where you could repaint the screen by tapping your cane to make sound.  What do people think?
 
Lawn Mower Racer 
Typical Kart style mechanics, except mowing grass fills your boost meter. Laps become more challenging to optimize as the race continues due to opponents having already mowed grass on the track. Different terrains introduce risk/reward, like rough grass filling boost faster but slowing you down. Encourages finding new lines to race every time, which many opportunities for dynamic gameplay.
 
A game where you get fired from your job and go into debt 
Maybe karen takes the kids too.
 
What you can't see, can't hurt you 
The game could be a horror or a puzzle game, or both?The general idea is that so long as you aren't looking at something, it doesn't exist.For example:**1.** You could walk through doors backwards because they don't exist unless you can see them**2.** A monster could be trying to chase you and kill you, and the only way to not die is to make sure the monster never enters your field of view. This can be done by turning your back to the monster or maybe looking at the ground?**3.** There could also be a closed eye feature where you can close your character's eyes and then have to navigate a level in the dark from memories
 
Metal gear but its 3am and your trying to get eat cheese from the fridge 
The cheese at 3am was just an example, but t gist of the game is that it's a stealth/action game, perspective does not matter, where the stages are tour house where you try to do something, some examples that come to mids are the cheese, trying to avoid you little cousins when your family comes over, trying to retrieve something from your parents bedroom, stuff like that, stuff you would do IRL sometimes.Some gameplay elements I image would be present is a breath of the wild like sound meter, pets, people, and items u an interact with to distract something with, some items you can use like nerf gun or something you use to distract or attack, a rubber ball to distract with, that kind of stuff. A bartering system for pick entities to help distract  would also be cool, like give a cat some catnip to knock something over, or e aforementioned nerf gun to a hunger sibling to make distractions better.Hopefully I wasn't too wordy, I tend to do that and if you end up making this a reality all I request is a spot in the credits and a free copy if its paid
 
SIDEARM 
A 1v1 shooter game based in a map crowded with people.SIDEARM pits two agents against each other in that very map, sent there only with a task to eliminate the other.The twist that they're not sure who their target looks like.Armed with only a pistol, a weapon they can conceal, and a single piece of tactical equipment. The agents must blend in with the crowd while attempting to locate their enemy, Agents can opt to use alternate routes to gain vantage points with a larger field of view at the risk of being spotted if the deed is not executed well. An agents heartbeat will beat faster as they close the space between each other, but can only be heard once in a whileWhen an Agent locates thier target, they can draw their pistol to fire at his adversary, but its not long before the people around see the pistol, prompting them to back off, and eventually run. Firing a pistol instanly causes the masses to flee the area.Eventually, the crowd flees, leaving the two agents to face off in a shoot out, using their equipment to switch positions or disorient the other.After a minute or so, the police arrive and try to intervene, making the battle more intense, forcing the agents to end the bout faster.Only one can leave victorious.Well, couldn't you just gun down a group of people and hopefully hit your opponent?Harming or Killing innocents will deduct your score, not just a small amount though, killing just a few can lose you more points than you can win a round with, forcing agents to be more careful with their weapons.The same for the police which show up in the endgame, it is adviced to hide and evade them instead of shooting, unless an agent is backed against to corner.SIDEARM plays on a few rounds, on a score based scheme. Agents have different appearances every round, only their movements can be used as evidence to locate adversaries.Pistols are hard to control, and can be fired blindly over cover at a lower accuracy. Different pistols can be used, each with their own strenghs, and their own tradeoffs.However, guns are not born equal, using weaker guns can grant a slight increase in score to make winning easier. Score aside from elimination can be acquired by doing small missions, but you'll look suspiscious doing so and should be attempted to make up for mistakes or and opponent winning with weaker weapons.This is all the ideas i have at the moment, do suggest anything in the comments to add onto this or balance the game :)
 
An MMO game where half of the players are actually advanced AIs programmed to act like players. 
Part of the game would be figuring out which people are robots and which are actually people. The robots would learn to chat like players, and every game update would make them more player-like. They would start at level 1 like regular players and level up the same way. Imagine starting a strong guild with lots of close friendships, only to find out that some of them are actually bots the entire time!&#x200B;Every time a character makes an account, another "bot" account is created. Perhaps the bot would be the opposite gender of the corresponding player to keep it balanced, and be reversed in other ways.
 
A game where you play through multiple times with multiple classes, but you can replay a "recording" of a previous playthrough with a different class to affect what happens in your current playthrough. 
[](/goodjob)A variety of game genres could work for this, but I imagine it as a 2D metroidvania style game. I think this would work best with a shortish countdown timer of something like 4 hours, where you can do different things to have sweeping affects on the world kind of Majora's Mask style. The difference being that the game is built on taking advantage of that and using multiple playthroughs to set yourself up for your ultimate goal.Like you play through as the Knight and defeat the Lich about an hour in, which allows travel through the Swamp on the other side of the map. You can then start up a Rogue and be there at the right time to take advantage of that and get across the swamp right away instead of having to spend time traveling, while your Knight continues to do their thing. Perhaps you unlock events or opportunities your own class cannot take advantage of, like that Rogue unlocking a Fireball spell for your Wizard to use.If you want to get real convoluted and add layers of strategy, you could make it so that you have to prevent paradoxes. Like if you buy the Magic Sword with your knight at 3 hours in, it needs to still be in the shop. Your Rogue can buy it themselves but it needs to be sold back to the shop before the Knight goes to buy it or else a paradox happens, either ending the game or stopping the Knight recording where it is. You would probably want to do a lot of periodic auto-saving so you can go back in your current playthrough and change how you play to fix these events before they happen again.
 
Inventory management game for a hero npc 
A game where you are in charge of sorting incoming items for the inventory of a hero that you're not playing as.The inventory is a 10x6 grid where items take various combination of space and can be both moved and rotated.You would have a text log somewhere on the screen telling you what's happening "out there", like the hero taking a new quest, or slaying a certain enemy.You would have to make sure you have room for potions when the hero needs them and also not discard any important quest items.[Interface preview I made many years ago](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/00pdsh5gt4o97q9/chrome_2020-01-03_21-41-24.jpg)[And a bunch of item ideas](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/d9pgzi8fslfvo8d/chrome_2020-01-03_21-44-09.jpg)
 
Drop chances system that prioritizes dropping items that haven't been dropped yet 
So this is something I came up with because of how grinding for something incredibly rare can feel like a tunnel that never ends. The rare items would still be rare but the more you grind the less tedious it would feel to actually get the item in question. Here is what I came up with:&#x200B;When one or more items are dropped from a single enemy (Or other source, doesn't matter), all the items that *could have* been dropped but *weren't*, have their drop odds increased. This happens at a percentage of their default value, so rarer items would have their odds increased by a much smaller amount regardless of how high their odds actually get.All the items that *were* dropped have their drop odds reset to their default values, or if an item was *already* at their default value or lower, it's drop odds will instead be decreased. This also happens at a percentage of their default value. Drop odds cannot be decreased to 0.&#x200B;Tl;dr: Items get increased chances of dropping the more it doesn't drop
 
A touchscreen tablet game that's like Twister for your fingers. 
The touchscreen has a bunch of colored blobs you must touch and keep touching. The blobs then start slowly moving, stretching, twisting and contorting like amoeba trying to escape from under your fingers. If you let go of a blob, you lose.You *can* put a second finger on the same blob to lift your first finger off. In fact, it's downright necessary to do things like this for the harder single-player levels. The game expects you to turn the tablet over with your foot if you have to. As long the blob is held down one way or another, you're golden.The game could also have multiplayer party modes with a variety of rule sets (such as a mode that lets you push some blobs into other players' blobs to split them in twain, and force them to use yet another finger).
 
Keep the light source from dying 
So you're all alone in a little suburban neighborhood full of blood thirsty vampires and you'll have to survive each night with nothing but your lighting equipments. In the day, you'll have to search houses for gasoline to power your generators and also look for food, weapons, etc. During the night, the vampires are free to roam around and they will try to siege your house. The light will keep them away but it will slowly run out of energy. Also, your generator will break occasionally so you'll have to repair them. The traps you laid out of your home will slow down the vampires. If you ran out of gasoline and are really desperate, you can go out and look for some but there are vampires outside. You'll have to wait till sunrise for the vampires to hide away. Then it's another day to survive.
 
You’re a monster that has to stop people from getting in to your house, building, haunted mansion or something like that, and you have the choice to either kill them or erase their memories. 
Basically you’re a monster that resides in a building that only appears at night. Tons of people want to get in to take photos, but you have to stop them to keep your existence a secret. When people enter the building, it puts them on a random floor, and depending on what floor it is it makes a different sound. If they take a lot of photos and leave, you lose and you have to start again. If you manage to catch the human before they take too many pictures, you can choose to either kill them on the spot or go to the basement to erase their memories of the place. Depending on if you killed most people, erased most people’s memories or kept it even, you would get a different ending. There would also be secret rooms in the building that give lore reveals. It would take the classic five nights formula like Fnaf where you have to survive until 6AM.
 
A game where you literally expand your consciousness in-game by adding new "panels" to the hud 
You are an alien entity commanding a nanobot size mech that has entered a human body. Youve plugged in to the central nervous system but start off only with 2 basic black and white monitors for the eye vision and some very basic control of the humans motor skills. Once you upgrade you can add other monitors like infrared vision, radar sweep style motion detectors, even "eyes in the back of your head"! You can even expand the size of different monitors. Periodically the human tries to retake control so you must fight against its erratic movements - adds a fun handicap plus its great for adding high difficulty challenges. Besides controlling the human occasionally you will have to explore parts of the body in the nanobot such as travel to the bladder to mine a gallstone for minerals for upgrade parts or zoom around an artery dodging white blood cells and destroying virus'. Think inner-space/anatomy park but you can pimp out a nanobot until its like its a spy plane
 
2D Platformer Combined With Some Ideas Generated From This Sub 
Basically my game idea is a 2d platformer like hollow knight. The background environment is a ground rich with small life ( Bugs, insects, small plants etc). But this environment is in a lab. Scientists are studying the insects and bugs. So they created a small environment for them. The interesting part is this lab is located in the international space station. One day there going to be a sudden blast with lots of radiation. There are ants in this lab environment and inside the ant colony there are ant eggs. Because of the radiation one egg gives birth to mutated ant. This ant is our main character.This ant is somewhat creepy. This ant can make web like spiders. Fly like dragonfly. Got sting like bees etc.  And this ant can use it powers ( mutations ) to overcome the problems.When each level is passing mutated ant have to give up it powers one by one. (Ex : Give up dragonfly wings after level 1 )(  Early game too powerful but eventually u have to depend on your brain,  Not powers. )There are some levels with low gravity. There are some secret mutations even the ant doesn't know ( Time travel power ??? Final Boss is The Same ant In the start of the game maybe )Finally the Mutated Ant wants to find out who it is actually. What Happened to it? (Player get all the abilities at first and eventually he have to remove them one by one - Idea got from this sub.)I'm a university student reading IT degree. Now I'm doing work as an Intern. I have no experience with Unity or Godot. But I got programming knowledge. This idea came to my mind because of GitHub game off. I really wanted to create this game but because of the intern work I got no time. So I thought sharing this idea with you'll would be great.Please ignore any English language mistakes as my native language is not English.
 
A limbo/inside style game about the myth of Sisyphus. 
Dont know why this popped into my head, it just did. Stylized 2d physics platformer about the myth of sisyphus, who cheated death and was sentenced to roll a boulder up a hill, but always have it roll back down at the last second. Imagine using the boulder to solve puzzles and reach new places, but also having to find a way to get it to the end with you to continue to fulfill your mission. Obviously not very developed but with enough style and gameplay mechanics I think it could make for a somber yet enjoyable experience.
 
A game like Pokemon, except you play as the kids who are playing Pokemon 
That headline was confusing, so let me explain.I've always had a soft spot for games that are set in real, modern-day society — much like Persona or TWEWY. I like the feeling of balancing school/work life against some other supernatural pursuit. Even Harry Potter has this feeling to it. It allows you to write characters that are genuinely relateable, but still provide gameplay that's more interesting than simply going to school/work.Now, what if we had an RPG where the kids were — canonically — playing an AR game like Pokemon GO? I imagine it to be somewhat like Persona. The daytime segments would involve school life, and the after school segments would involve running around the neighborhood, catching Pokemon, and fighting rival trainers.You could still structure it like a regular Pokemon game with 8 gyms if you want to. Just make the characters a bit older (high school instead of late elementary school), and have them travel around the city in search of these MMO hotshots. And of course the gym leaders will all be hilarious in real life — the turbo nerd, the guy who looks like a jock but actually plays video games, etc etc.Well, that would be cool, but I really imagine it more like [Boku no Natsuyasumi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX2I0YanKMg) (which I haven't played yet, but it looks great). A game where you can just run around town and be a kid, but contextualized with the objective of catching new Pokemon and training to "be the best".
 
A game where you are a politician trying to prevent Hitler rising to power in 1930's Germany 
Welcome to the Reichstag, 1929. You are a politician working for the Social Democratic party and in the face of the worst economic crash the nation has seen in centuries, a radical party called the National Socialist German Worker's Party's popularity has gone through the roof. You decided to read their manifesto and quickly realise that if they go into power, which is not an absurd possibility, millions of people could die. In the face of elections looming in the near future, you have made your life goal to prevent them from going into power and saving the unstable democratic regime of the Weimar Republic.But they aren't the only threat! At the same time, left-wing Communist forces are making themselves dominant across Germany, and the Fatherland would be no better off if they come to power.Don't really have many ideas for features, maybe some sort of speechwriter where you choose words to sway public opinion, definitely voting in the Reichstag, rising the ranks of the Social Democrats, influencing newspapers? Not sure. If you could help with ideas (or make this game), that would be great.&#x200B;Edit: Depending on whether you win or lose, you get an epilogue (of the three below) detailing what happens (along these lines. If anybody has better ideas of what I missed or mistakenly put in, please tell me below):&#x200B;Win (crushing popular support/fixing the economy): Despite saving tens of millions of people and dodging a world war, you are mainly forgotten in history and live out the rest of your life peacefully, knowing how big of a bullet you and the world dodged. A minor cold war breaks out between the Soviet Union and the west, but the force of a singular democratic stable Germany means the Soviet Union quickly loses it and is forced to become a democracy. Along the way, Willi Schmid starts the Neo-Classicism movement in music and Philip K. Dick writes *The Death of Peace*, a book on what would have happened if Adolf Hitler had taken control of Germany.&#x200B;Win (banning fascism and communism): Following the great Scare of the early 1930's in Germany, a Reichstag monopolised by the Social Democrats in Germany took control and steered the nation out of the Great Depression. It was a hard transition, with resistance on all sides, but eventually the nation's economy recovers and it pays back its war reparations as stipulated in Versailles. A minor cold war breaks out between the Soviet Union and the west, but the force of a democratic stable Germany means the Soviet Union quickly loses the war, its economy tanks and the Americans create the Russian Federation. Along the way, Willi Schmid starts the Neo-Classicism movement in music and Philip K. Dick writes *The Death of Peace*, a book on what would have happened if Adolf Hitler had taken control of Germany.&#x200B;Win (killing Hitler during his opening speech as Führer\*): Following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, he gave a speech at the Reichstag announcing the dawn of a new era of Germany, probably. We don't know what he was going to say because halfway through his introduction he was shot dead by an ex-politician who worked in the Social Democratic Party. After this, and without another powerful leader for the National Socialists, Germany fell into a period of near-anarchy known as *die Probleme*. Eventually, a military dictator unified Germany once more, leading it for 12 years until the peaceful Azure Revolution brought democracy back to Germany. The Cold War was very strange, with both world powers trying to influence the splintered nation states of Germany until the Azure Revolution sealed the fate of the nation. To this day, some speculate that the United States of America had a hand in starting the Azure Revolution.&#x200B;Lose (fascists take control): Adolf Hitler seizes control of Germany and in a number of bloody purges kills his political opponents, including you. Along the way, his dictatorial power stabilises the German economy and builds a new army to replace the one imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. He kills millions of people in concentration and death camps across his rule and drags the world into another world war. He loses, but millions more people die along the way. What follows is a terrifying standoff enveloping the entire world for forty-five years between the West and the Soviet Union and a divided Germany until the Cold War ends.&#x200B;Lose (communists take control): Once the Communists take control of Germany, they are swift in ending fascism, along with all other political parties in Germany. As in the above, you die. The Democratic Republic of Germany joins the Comintern and use their combined power to subjugate Eastern Europe and make them communist. The ensuing Cold War is eventually won by the Communists, but lasts 125 years. The shroud of Communism takes over the entire world, but is slowly pushed back from the Earth in a series of bloody rebellions, beginning in North America and sweeping eastward across the globe.&#x200B;\*This is a secret victory that gets you an achievement if you do it.
 
Kidnapped 
A multiplayer 1 vs 4 (can be increased if you think the number is too small) game where one person is the kidnapper and the other four are the kidnapped. Each match would be a randomly generated house meaning each house is going to look and feel different making no game the same. Rules are simple really, the kidnapper has to make sure the kidnapped do not escape while the kidnapped have to find a way out with one exception.. The kidnappers nosy old mother. The mother would be an NPC that can either assist the kidnapper or the kidnapped. The kidnapper has to take care of his mother who is constantly roaming the house but is deaf. If mother sees a kidnapped victim she will immediately call cops making it game over for the kidnapper. If the kidnapper completes mothers list of tasks and requests around the house then this will ensure that she remains seated instead of roaming the house but in the meantime the kidnapper will not have his eyes on the kidnapped.The kidnapper can give orders to the kidnapped such as moving them seperately around the house to different rooms in order to complete mothers requests for him. During this time the kidnapped can either follow instructions or rebel instead and look for an escape route and try to sneak out of the house or go save your fellow kidnapped friends. If the kidnapper spots an individual rebelling he then has the option to kill them or spare them.Each kidnapped could have a different skill including the escapee who is cunning and quick allowing them to switch tasks or move extra fast, the problem solver who has experience in picking locks and breaking out in general, the tough guy who is able to fight back against the kidnapper or smash through certain areas and a former friend of the kidnapper who knows the layout of the house and where he usually places certain items.The kidnapper could have a range of different items such as handcuffs, mouth gag, blindfold etc to use on the kidnapped. Sorry i had to rush this post as i need to leave the office soon so i tried to get the general idea of the game down without going into too much specifics.. If something does not make sense or you have a question then feel free to ask!
 
SCP survival game 
I’m a massive fan of survival games, stuff like rust and especially Ark. and I also like the fictional characters in the scp universe, so why not try and mix the two together. This game will be a survival just like ark, but you are in a dark forest with different scp wondering about (some passive some hostile) you can gather materials and work on building your scp foundation (can build structures such as Scp room A, Scp room B and Scp room C. Each room will be specific in materials, like room A will need much stronger materials for the walls and doors, so it can hold the stronger and much more dangerous Scp’s) breaking trees, rocks and mining materials can grab the attention of wondering Scp’s so you’ll definitely need some sort of weapon to protect yourself (pistols, shotguns, SMGs and rifles) That was the main description of the game. so now I’ll go into more detail about certain things The map:The map will be set map with randomly generated materials such as stone, wood and different types of minerals. It will be a dark forest with caves plotted here and there. The forest will be extremely dark and completely overgrown. The only way you can see is with a torch, flare or flashlight.Scp’s: The map will be scattered with many different types of scp, some small some colossal. These different Scp’s will be completely different to eachother (ideas for the Scp’s can be easily found online) these roaming Scp’s can be super friendly or super aggressive and sometimes a Scp can seem friendly but then can rip you in half unexpectedly. Every single Scp can be “tamed” they will have different ways to be tamed such as knock out. Helping it find its food. Raising the Scp from a young age. Or even creating your own Scp. You will be able to play as each Scp (or pilot them depending on what type) mid way through the game you can unlock a machine (haven’t thought of a name yet) that will let you take over the mind of your Scp. Each Scp has a different set of abilities. Some may be able to see in the dark. Some can move at incredible speeds and maybe some can scare off other Scp’s with its terrifying look. (While not controlling an Scp it has a chance of becoming hostile, trying to kill you and your other Scp’s, so keeping them locked up will prevent that from happening)Combat: Combat is going to be decently hard to get right, but what I was thinking was an ark type combat but after you kill a creature it’ll show a little animation of you tearing off body parts or swallowing them whole. But as a player you have a set of weapons/tools that you could use to fight off Scp’s, early game items can be things such as metal swords, spears and maybe even a bow, late game items will have thing like guns, electric prods and even power armour. Not quite sure what else to talk about with the combat haven’t thought it out fully yet, would love to hear feed back if possible.Crafting/material gathering:Gathering materials would be simple, you start off with nothing, you have to find rocks on the floor to help you break trees to get wood, you then use the wood to craft tools, such as hatchet, pick axe and a knife to help you gather more materials. Later on after making your pick axe you can go deep in caves to find iron, copper and other metals. You can then use these metals to upgrade your tools or maybe build traps for the Scp’s or places to keep your Scp safe and secure. Adding a crafting bench system seems like a good idea and maybe for the late game you can build an advanced crafting table so you can learn more advanced tools such as a jack hammer, or better guns.Building: Building is so hard to get right in games Especially one like this, but I believe building should be looked at and inspected by someone who has a better idea than me. Inventory: The inventory will be something that you will have to make tough decisions if you want to do such things as gather wood, go mining because, you can only carry 2 items, which could be a pistol and a hatchet or maybe if your just going out to kill Scp’s and maybe tame them, a shot gun and rifle, later on I. The game when you can finally learn the bigger guns, they will take up both slots so you can only carry 1 gun/tool, unless you make the the tool belt or ammo belt. You can only have 1 if these on at a time. So you have the option do you want more ammo or do you want an extra gun or do you want something you can go gather materials with. You also have weight. Guns will take up most of that weight but bullets will take up a decent amount aswel. So if you want to go gather a lot more materials you will have to take less bullets with you bring back more of it. But some of your Scp’s can have abilities to help you carry more items or materials.Other:This game is going to be decently hard. Where if you are not wearing armour you can be taken on in surprise and have your legs and arms ripped off in a second, so making armour and weapons is important. The map can be decently large with mountains, caves and very dense overgrown forests. Scp’s will have their own noise so you can tell if one is near by. Each Scp has their own weakness. Sorry if some of this didn’t make any sense or it’s a completely shit idea I’m a 15 year old at 2AM trying to think about what game I would want to play. Feel free to build upon this idea or feel free to tell me that it’s completely shit. Thanks for taking the time to read this Seriously this is a long ass idea because I tried to go in depth as I possibly could, but I may have forgotten some key features because I am very tired.Edit: some Scp’s are very radioactive. So certain suits will be needed to go near them.Edit 2: I’ve just realised I’ve missed key features such as inventory, so I will update this tomorrow when I wake up.Edit 3: wow thank you for the upvotes and feedback, I understand this project will be a long long project to make. But my idea was to add 1 Scp into the game at a time, so you could start the game off with only 1 Scp, but later on you could add new Scp’s, but as you add a new Scp it will take longer to add more because each Scp will have a different animation after dying or killing one another, so the first main focus would be on the map, which again will take a decent amount of time because maps with the little details are a lot more fun to explore.
 
A 2D game in the style of a cave painting. 
I don't really have much else besides that. Like, enemies, players and objects are painted on, and the terrain that you traverse is dictated by the texture of the walls. Could make for an interesting metroidvania or maybe a platformer. I don't think the art style would work in the top down perspective like Zelda. You could go around fighting prehistoric fauna with a spear (there aren't many games with spears as a main weapon), which could be used for pole vaulting and holding open doors or something. The whole game could have a torchlit aesthetic. Maybe you could get a bow and arrow as well, or maybe there could be a crafting system with tiers. For variety, different areas could have different stone types, with maybe backgrounds carved into the stone, or like dead trilobytes and stuff embedded. When you die your body could become a faded version of itself, to mark points of death, and with each successive death each one fades one more level, allowing maybe three at a time.or, it could fade over time and you only have a limited time to get back to it to get your xp and stuff. Maybe you could tame a wolf in the game as well.
 
A game where you are a ghost in a cemetery that can enter the graves of dead people and change their past. 
When walking through the cemetery you could read the graves and the causes of death, or see family members murmuring (in text or voices) some regret about their loved ones giving a clue of how they died and that they could have avoided it. The ghost could "enter" the graves and enter a level that represents the exact moment of that person's death, and the player could choose to take an action to save or not save that person, and if they do so when they return to the graveyard, the grave disappears.To make it more interesting, you could make a limit of trips for the ghost since each time it exhausts its own vital energy, and it could also make a connection between the lives of people, in such a way that if one is saved this is change the future for others. The end could be that the character is saved through a certain combination of people whose futures were changed. And make this one have no memories of his death.
 
A strategy game based on nomadic lifestyle 
It could be cool to have a strategy game where your success depends on how well you can lead your people group or tribe by moving around instead of expanding the geographical borders. You would have to think in a very different way than traditional strategic games.You can prosper through trading, herding animals, hunting, fighting other people groups or a combination of these. A big part of the game would be to know when you need to move, at what pace and also how you should deal with other tribes or even towns. Other nomadic groups have their own routines, and you can either respect their travelling patterns and avoid conflict or confront them.  You also need to have a good knowledge of the land, to take most advantage of the resources. Weather patterns play a role, and if you stay too long in one place the food in that area will deplete. However, moving too early is a risk as well.The game is very cyclical and it is hard to progress and become huge as you never stay permanently in one place for long. Instead, for each year you gain points depending on how well that year went. The better you manage to find a good routine and adapt to the surroundings year by year, the better you score. Difficulty can be adjusted by adjusting AI behaviour and advantages, and also how rough the nature on your map is.Interesting dilemmas that can occur during a game are:- Should we follow the same route as last year, or take our chances to take another route?- Should we stay on lands we know well, or explore new lands?- How should we act when meeting other groups?- What is our main source of food?- Should we stay as one big group, or split up?I picture it as a top- down view of a nice- looking map with a lot of layers to turn on and off to show important information about the land.I think it can be a cool game with these core mechanics, but to add flavor we can for example have different skills and traits on the people in the tribe. Some skills can influence how accurate the information on the map is, while other skills decides the food output or the fighting ability.It could be either turn- based or RTS like Europa Universalis where you can control the speed and pause if needed. It could work as a multiplayer game, with players controlling a tribe each.What do you think? If there is allready a game like this, please let me know.
 
Venga Bus Simulator 
You play as the Venga Boys bus driver, and you drive the Venga Bus, attempting to bring the disco to New York and San Fransisco. Except its 2021 and everyone hates you and your music, so the aim of the game is to reach said cities while being relentlessly run off the road and shot at. [Soundtrack is already sorted.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyKZERWFUIU&ab_channel=8BitUniverse)Lemme know when one of you makes a million with this idea, k?
 
Novel ideas for nsfw games? 
I know we tend to shun sexual topics in society and most developers will hesitate to associate themselves with making a nsfw game, but a part of me is genuinely curious if the nsfw genre could be pushed further and what would creativity look like in nsfw games if we have a little less judgement for sexual contents.I played a few flash dating sims when I was young (e.g. Ganguro Girl) and I've always remembered them as fun and immersive. From the gameplay of studying > working > and buying gifts for the girl, to the reward cutscenes you get at the end, they were all polished and well-executed for flash games.A couple months ago, I had a few looks at random indie nsfw games and I saw their focus went towards exaggerated 3D visuals with less story and gameplay. I feel they kind of missed the essence that made nsfw games immersive.So I hope this question doesn't get immediately laughed off and you'll take a few moments to consider and leave a comment if you have and interesting and novel ideas for nsfw games!Edit: Oh by "novel ideas" I don't mean visual novel, visual novel is fine but I meant to say "new / unique ideas" lol, sorry for the misunderstanding.
 
Stealth Game from the Perspective of a Guard 
Ever wonder what the grunt guards in Assassin's Creed or Arkham Asylum are thinking? What is it like to have an unseen entity constantly toy with you for hours on end? In this game you play as a nightguard, protecting a rare (and valuable) diamond in a museum. A stealthy thief is trying to steal the diamond for himself, and he has very creative ways of messing with you, such as tranquilizer darts that make you slower, or shadow-casting that makes you think you're seeing him. However, you can set traps too, like a bear trap, or cutting off his favorite exits, or spilling some oil so he'll slip. You can also shoot paintballs at him to follow his trail. Once you finally get close enough to him, you can bash him with your nightstick! The game is a constant back and forth between the night guard and the thief until one of them dies, the diamond is captured, or the timer runs out.
 
A horror game that happens in a kids drawing program 
As a kid, I've had nightmares of computer programs having malicious intent. I thought it would be cool to put that into a game.It would take place in the early 2000s and feature a program like kid pics 3D. Everything feels off and uncanny. Maybe a little bit sinister. Maybe it'll have a creepy 2000s pre rendered guide that teaches you how to draw. As the game goes on, things get a little bit more intense and twisted.Sure. It sounds crazy. But unique games become phenomenons in the Indie game industry. Think about all the easter eggs and alternate endings you could pack into it.
 
Rope: The Game 
A puzzle platformer where you have to reach a flag to finish a level. The catch is, the path you take through out the entire level is drawn as rope, from the starting point to the final flag. Later paths are drawn on top of earlier ones. When you finish, the game then pulls the two ends. You get more points for making fewer knots, tying around certain points, or matching shapes.
 
A game where you just go through and declutter an email account, forming a hierarchy of important emails and trashing the unimportant one 
I don't know. I guess there would have to be a story to catch on to and follow.I just find great satisfaction in going through my mailEdit: "ones" not "one
 
Utilizing aliasing as a game mechanic 
For example, you have to climb a very steep ramp, which you can't, so you lower the resolution in the settings to form a staircase. I don't know if anyone has had this idea before, it just came to me and I thought it was too interesting to let go.
 
An RPG taking place in ancient India based around karma and reincarnation 
Basically a standard rpg taking place in ancient - medieval India, where whenever you die, you’ll be put into the shoes of a new character. What position this character is in will be based on your karma of the previous live. This is very broad, but basically you can start off in the shoes of a poor farmer peasant or thief, and each life you can do good or bad deeds that effect your next life once you die. This could go on to the point where you could be a king or conqueror. You would have to try to balance your money, well-being, inventory, etc and your karma, where you could refuse the payment for certain tasks to gain more karma, or take the money to be able to buy more things for your current life. Just a little, very underdeveloped idea I had. I have no game making knowledge or skills, so I don’t know if this would even be possible, but I thought it was a neat idea. Let me know if u have any thoughts
 
Instead of building a city, you improve existing neighbourhoods 
Due to the focus on neighbourhoods, the game engine can focus more closely on urban design: street design (bike paths and bike bike parking, trams, buses etc) and building design (down to windows, balconies, colours, murals, street art, materials and other design features). The building environment changes based on your changes. You can attract creative businesses. You can attract certain demographics. You can earn revenue by increasing the land rent and if businesses are successful. 
 
A tree/forest simulator with elements from Civilization and Sim City 
Hey everyone! I’m new here and I’ve never really pitched any of my gaming ideas before. More or less I just want to throw this out there but if someone actually wants to work on creating it, I’m definitely open to collaboration. I have zero experience on the technical side but for this particular game I have a lot of details already set in place. Anyways, here’s the basic concept. You start out as a seed in the middle of an empty plot of land. You then spend each turn trying to grow and flourish while dealing with nature, enemies, other plants/animals/weather, etc. I know that sounds lame so let me elaborate and give you an idea of a normal play through. So each game/map will be unique. You’ll be shown a small portion of the map and decide where you want to plant your seed. The type of seed, also effects difficulty and such. For instance Redwood takes the longest, starts out the hardest but by endgame you utterly dominate. A pine tree is essentially the opposite.Once you start the game, you have an insect/animal companion that serves as your scout/manager. The tree is your main “city” and the creature is what you control. You start out as a beetle, upgrade to a fly, then a squirrel, then a bird and then potentially beyond that. Each new form gives you new abilities and expands the universe. For instance, the beetle cant move very far on the map but they can slowly bring back nutrients to the seed. Once you reach a certain point you can upgrade to a fly... which, spoiler alert, can fly. So they can move further, find more resources, etc. There will also be several variants of each level. Once your tree starts to grow, each turn is dedicated to:- scouting the map-upgrading your tree (base/city). The roots gather water, the leaves gather sunlight, the bark is defense, etc. -building relationships with other plants/animals. The briars will provide defense, the birds will drop seeds to expand your community, the skunks will repel human enemies. Stuff like that. Each turn, which is considered a month of real time, will help boost you resources, explore the map and handle your relationships with the other factions. Throughout each game (btw a play through is meant to be anywhere from 1-20 hours) you also have to deal with several obstacles. For instance, termites can obliterate your tree. Lightning can set you back for months. Humans who vandalize your tree can cripple you. Etc. However, your tree can absolutely flourish into a wonderful forest.So the game I would most compare it to is Civilization, at least that’s the easiest way to describe it. For instance on each play through, you can set the number of opponents that you have to either ally with or eliminate in order to win the game. There are three factions: plants/trees, animals and humans. Eliminating or joining forces with them has huge benefits but until you do so, they will be trying to eliminate you, or at the very least, can start taking resources and land from you. As far as the benefits, let’s say you eliminate a human faction. Growth becomes much easier in their territory now that they’re gone. If you ally with them, they will protect you from animals (deers eat your small plants/saplings, woodpeckers cause damage to your bark/defense, squirrels eat your seeds/acorns, etc) Seasons also play a huge factor and there will be random events as well. For example you can only expand your territory (by planting seeds) in the spring and summer months. For events, they’re largely weather dependent. You can be blessed with a rain storm that helps your trees grow faster or there might be a lightning storm that strikes your main tree. I’m trying to write this quickly before work so you’ll have to excuse the fact that it’s all over the place. Anyways, I think the game has potential as a PC game or maybe even on Mobil. Eventually it could be on consoles as well (Switch particularly would be a good fit). It could certainly be multiplayer (a sped up mode like in Civ) but for the most part I have ideas as a single player game. Thoughts?
 
A Steampunk FPS RPG with a Lovecraftian twist. 
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe where there is extreme heights/alpine regions, deep ocean depths, and flat deserts in between with most settlements only accessible by airship. The player’s goal is to stop a cult known as the “dreamers” from summoning Cthulhu (or any other lovecraftian godlike entity) and drowning the rest of the world by raising the oceans. The player must recruit either one of three factions to help them; the Teslalonians (a scientific faction that studies sea life and mostly stay in underwater laboratories), the Red Terrorhawks (a faction of mercenaries and freelancers that occasionally skirt the authorities with illicit activities), or the Sons of Sanctorum (a authoritarian/imperialist faction that seeks to bring order to the surrounding wasteland). Each faction would have their own distinct weapons and armor for the player to acquire after gaining the loyalty of each respective faction. Gameplay would be similar to Fallout:NV with the addition of the player’s own airship that can be customized and would function similarly to ship combat from Assassins Creed:IV. Of course there would be dialogue choices, companions, specializations, side-quests, etc. This is what I have so far in terms of concept, does this sound interesting at all? I don’t see much in terms of the steampunk genre in gaming so idk if there is an audience for this kind of game.
 
Non-Detailed List of Half Baked Ideas 
I like to sit down and brainstorm a lot of ideas so I figured someone might find them interesting enough, even if it's just a project to do while you're still learning&#x200B;* A cooking game where in addition to normal cooking you need to poison certain customers in different ways (be is arsenic or lead, etc) just right so they die but do it far away from your store* A puzzle game where the puzzles and story are generated based on how the last puzzle was solved* A cyberpunk western about breaking into cryptovaults and stealing bitcoin* A survival game set in prehistoric ireland. Mythical creatures included.* A city builder where you play as aliens slowly taking over earth* A fashion game where you need to design clothes at a profit. Value would be tied to your reputation, mesh of colours, angle similarity, difference from last design, etc.* A horror cooking game* A tactical rpg set in the future. Your objective is to end the last monarchyI've got quite a bit more but didn't want a 50+ bullet list, so if you'd like to see them [I've been working on a neat website dedicated to this sort of stuff](https://sushimus.github.io/)&#x200B;Edit: I wanted to thank you guys for the awesome feedback so far on my website. I've made a list of stuff to get done and all the critiques are on it. Currently working on knocking it all out right now
 
Whats the smallest acceptable open world size for you? 
For a skyrim type of game
 
A game where you play as nature and it's your goal to have a world which as much life and biodiversity as possible 
A win would be a rainforest or maybe something even better. A loss would be a dessert. Challenges include evasive species (haven't decided whether this includes humans) and weather. You can control weather to a certain extent to fend off evasive species (I saw a video where a forrest in the US reintroduced wolves, and it changed the whole park to become more green because they ate evasive species), but you mainly use other species or DNA points to change species in order to create a balance. If a bug begins to eat all the plants, you can create a new disease which might have effects on something else, or you can upgrade or introduce an animal that eats these bugs, but these might also eat something that is beneficial. You constantly have to weight pros and cons in order to make your nature the biggest and most powerful. 
 
A battle royale but lava rises from the floor instead of the circle shrinking 
That’s it
 
A game where you are a homeless person and you have to try and live your daily tasks without getting caught by police and other people 
It would be semi open world, so you can explore your environment and it changes while you’re in that area but when you leave the area you enter a 2d map of the city to fast travel to.You have to do basic tasks and when you die another homeless person takes your shit and you have to start over. You can fight other homeless people and take their shit as well.You must:Bathe, if you don’t you will struggle to find people willing to give money or food because you smell badGet clothes, if your clothes are too dirty you will get sickTreat illness, if you get sick you will die if untreatedEat food, without food you will dieSleepFind warmthGet moneyAnd have social interactions otherwise you will enter a state of psychosis and kill itselfFailure to perform the aforementioned processes within a few in game days results in your character either dying or receiving penalties which makes surviving harder.Certain items either obtained from purchasing them or dumpster diving can be carried around as weapons. For instance you can purchase air freshener or cologne with the intent of freshening up, but it can also be used as pepper spray. Or maybe you can make shanks out of turkey legs or even just straight up buy a knife from the storeThe game is completed when you buy yourself an apartment and live in it for 4 days without dying, you can then enter free play where you keep playing with slower death penalties and you can buy other apartments and stuff like that, but don’t go too overboard because you still have to pay rent and if you run out of money you might go homeless again and your character loses all its shitPolice will get called when you do illegal stuff (bathing in fountains, killing homeless people, robbing stores, etc.) so you gotta balance illegal stuff with good stuff otherwise the game will get super hard**TLDR**You control a homeless person in a 3D semi open world, you have to make sure all their health stats are satisfied or else survival is made harder or you dieYou can kill other homeless people for their supplies, other homeless people will kill you as wellFind weapons to make it easier to defend yourselfBut don’t go overboard with illegal stuff or the cops will get you
 
MMO where every few months the entire community have a limited time to collaborate against world ending events, and if they fail the servers just permanently shut down. 
It will never happen because money, but I thought of it whilst browsing r/destinythegame. would be interesting to follow at least.Edit: To clarify how I got the idea, every season in destiny 2, a community event will happen (which usually just consists of collecting resources and depositing them somewhere to tick up a percentage meter) but if it looks like the players are going to fail, Bungie just rig it in their favour. Got me thinking what would happen if the players actually failed.
 
A Jurassic Park game where you build your own park in the first half, and try and escape from said park away from all the dinos you cloned in the second 
[Inspired by this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/kr68mo/i_know_id_fill_the_first_half_of_the_game_with_as/) r/tumblr post They explain it way better than I possibly could
 
A game with branching storylines but all the choices are "hidden". 
So usually you make choices in games and while it's not always clear what the consequences are you always are aware when making a choice through dialogue options.   I had an idea where there is a game where all the choices are hidden inside completely mundane and subconscious things so you never know when something could be important.   For example a cutscene starts and depending on what weapon you have equipped at that point the cutscene could play out completely different and have huge consequences. Or if you do a mission wearing certain clothes it leads to different outcomes or during certain weather.   It would be cool to always be surprised by the consequences of your subconscious choices and would make it unpredictable yet at the same time more personal and individual.
 
Fantasy-themed, brutal 5v5 arena FPS with Warriors, Archers, And Mages. 
Basically Mordhau modded to add magic. Near-realistic.Magic and anti-magic centers around Blessings and Damage Spells: **Mages:**A mage can one-shot or two-shot anybody, but the stronger projectiles are more dodgeable. You have to charge the really good spells, and you'll probably miss. But when you don't... it's awesome.Players can also deflect one or two magical killing blows using equipped, clearly visible magical amulets that break after one deflection. Friendly mages can also cast one-use blessings upon their allies. This effect is also visible.There are also an array of Blessings intended to help against physical attacks, but the main goal of Blessings is to counter enemy magic. That way, magic can be incredibly destructive and exciting, without being overpowered.Mages can cast low-damage area of effect spells or shortlived debuffs.Getting smacked by a powerful fireball will set you on fire screaming, and a frostbolt will interrupt your movement. If they strike on the ground a foot or two away, they should damage you a little and slightly deafen you.**Archers:**Archers are fast, but die easily. They have moderate, yet consistent damage against Warriors. Archers can kill mages very quickly because they have no armor, but the reverse is also true. Without armor, they die to mages' lighter attacks, and they get crumpled by warriors.They can also climb more easily, walk quietly, and backstab.**Warriors:**If a warrior gets in melee range, they win 90% of the time. They can charge up to the weaker units, all blessed up, and deflect spells and arrows while lopping a head off in one blow.Warrior vs. Warrior melee combat is super hard and skill based, like Mordhau.Mages can protect anyone from one physical death blow, so the light classes have a tiny bit of chance against a warrior, especially a wounded one. A great player can absolutely kill a bad warrior using the mage's ceremonial dagger, or what have you.**Game Objective:**Respawns, with an objective to attack, like a flag or series of flags. This creates more combat, less taking cover.This obviously isn't all specified out, but I want to give the feeling. It's Mordhau with fewer weapons and more magic.You're going to feel naked without at least one warrior, one archer, and one mage in the party, but you can do whatever you want.The map should have item pickups. This includes better weapons for warriors and archers, as well as consumable spell reagents.**Your Character**The game could either have moderate character customizations on 3-ish classes, or it could have 5-10 classes with very little or no customization. I probably prefer customization on base classes. You should probably be able to play as a "priest" a "berserker" and a "rogue" either way.There's also the option of no classes, only one malleable class that can have any weapons or spells within a budget, but that would probably make it harder to tell what's going on. A warrior could just forego pants, and just nuke you suddenly with the one fireball spell. Not the best.Magic also gives the game excuses to add in any convenient gameplay mechanic that would otherwise break realism. Like limited in-combat revives. And slightly higher survivability. But if nobody brings a mage or uses magic amulets, it's basically real life.**Practicality**Seems like you could just mod a game like Chivalry, Mordhau, etc.**Feedback**What types of character customization would you prefer in this context?Does this spark any other ideas?Do you have a class or archetype you'd want included? Or should that class be more of a "sub-class" of the main three?
 
A Transformers Battlefront like game 
I think a Transformer like Battlefront would be extremely fun, where every map you go is just chaos of two sides fighting for their beliefs. Maps: The maps will be larger to keep with the vehicles when transforming and will fight in Cybertron, An apocalyptic Earth, Earth during the dinosaurs, and maybe some other planets that have been  occupied by either Autobots or Decepticons. Gamemodes: A gamemode of clash between Trypticon and Omega Supreme or Metroplex. Supremacy like Battlefront 2, a Beast wars conflict type mode, and a Combiners Wars mode.Heros and Villians: The special characters would be famous characters loved by the community from Optimus to Grimlock and from Megatron to Bruticus.Classes: the classes will be ranged from Medic, Heavy, Assault, and Engineer. Each classes having its own abilities and customization. like in Fall of Cybertron you could make your own transformer, However you like but the abilities will pertain to the classes that the player chooses to play as and customize. Story mode: The story could be about the how the war started and how Megatron becomes the leader of the Decepticons and Optimus becoming the leader of the Autobots.
 
Platformer where the UI can collide with you 
Some random ideas:&#x200B;* Increase your score and climb on the numbers* Hover over an object and it shows information and you can jump on that information* Maybe you can use your mouse cursor as a platform
 
A first person horror where you need to hide you're sick 
It's the future! Plague is no more!  ..Or so you're taught as a kid..  Unsure how it was even possible you wake with a horrible cough and a blistering headache. What do you do? You'd heard rumours sick people get taken away and they're never seen again. It's probably best you hide it, this will blow over quickly enough.  It doesn't.  As the week progresses you start having horrid hallucinations, you can barely walk straight. Luckily so far people seem to think you've recently discovered a strong passion for drinking but how long until they tip off an authority something's odd about you? You need to figure out how to get better and fast, or at least stay hidden better.  By next week you've got a strong paranoia of anything moving, you decide only moving around at night is best. You even dart from alley to alley to avoid being spotted. You're hallucinations have gotten worse, everyone looks so grotesque and you're begining to beleive they're actually monsters.  Fast forward the plot because I've written the jist of it: The entire time you thought you were in a utopia you were in a stasis cell. The world around you is filled with horrid creatures just like your visions entailed, visions which happened because somehow a part of the virus managed to get into your pod. Your pod, being alerted to your worsening condition, opens and releases you into the real world and now you need to scramble around for a cure. A cure you'll never find. The game ends with you having more hallucinations you're back in your utopia like nothing ever happened and you die trying to find a cure that never existed.
 
[DEV Idea] Co-Op Town Development 
So I was thinking, ok we got our sim cities type of games, but they're all singeplayer. And I've played Skyblock in Minecraft in which you can create your island with teammates.What if there was a game? (static, made with PHP, but on mobile/PC), in which you work with your friends to make your town better? Your town would have shops, and the theme of the game would be evolution through eras.Every player would have 1 game character with some kind of development / class, but as I said, no crazy action going on, just a static game which you can enjoy with ALL of your friends (even non-gamer ones)I am a game dev with multiple games finished and published, so this is more of a written mini-prototype to hear everyone's feedback, would you like to see more from this idea? I have nothing to work on these days and I was thinking if this should be my next project.
 
Started working on the idea I posted a while ago. I need your suggestions. 
Here is the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/ida54w/a_first_person_shooter_in_pitch_darkness/). > The player must shoot terrorists in pitch dark. He has an ability which  will help him. He can shoot sonar pulses which travel and illuminate the  position of terrorists and obstacles just for a moment. Terrorists can  move in the dark, and player too must move in the dark and guess the  layout. He can only use certain amount of sonar pulses every level. I have improved the original idea for the game based on the comments. It would be of a great help if you can comment your suggestions. I am thinking to go with the name "alpha six going dark". I don't know if I can use that name. May be I will modify it to "charlie four going dark".Here is the first look:[https://youtu.be/4TXUys4Lucg](https://youtu.be/4TXUys4Lucg)
 
A map app, that slowly uncovers, as you explore your surroundings 
So I had this idea for an app, that encourages you to go out and explore, by giving you a blank map, that slowly unravels, as you walk around. It could have secret treasure chest, which are either located at known sights, or they could be at random places, so people, who live in rural areas aren't forced to go to big cities lol. The chests could have items, that make your exploration radius bigger or things like that, and leaderboards would be a thing, which show, who explored the most areas on earth, or who explored the most in 24 hours. It would also be a cool gimmick, to give players the opportunity to make puzzles, which give you items or secret messages/ pictures, which are selected by the player, who made the puzzle.
 
Please post design ideas, not experience ideas 
In the book "Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences" by Tynan Sylvester there's a paragraph titled "The Fallacy of Vision" (p. 304). It starts with a short story:> *A young aerospace engineer is at his first day of work. He goes into the boss’s office with a gleam in his eye, and declares, "I’ve got the greatest idea for a new kind of airplane."*> *The boss is intrigued. "Explain," he says.*> *The young engineer takes on a visionary expression and stares into the distance. "The passengers board hassle-free in five minutes. Then the plane takes off, silently, with barely a bump, as the passengers enjoy martinis in their private booths. As they soar over the Atlantic, a young couple enjoys the view in one of the plane’s many bubble canopies, and a cute kid gets a tour of the cockpit. The captain chuckles as the kid asks why they can’t fly to the moon. By the time they touch down, love has been found, lessons have been learned, and everybody is ready for whatever awaits them at their destination."*> *The boss leans back in his chair and takes a long drag on his cigar. "You’re fired," he says.*> &nbsp;> This young aerospace engineer had a vision. But his vision was of an airplane flight, not an airplane. He described a wonderful experience, but he  said  nothing  about  the  mechanical  systems  that  created  that  experience. He succumbed to the fallacy of vision.> **The FALLACY OF VISION is the idea that a mental movie of an experience is equivalent to a design for a system that generates that experience.**----In other words, when you post your ideas please avoid describing a single experience and try to describe how the game works and what does the player experience in general. Games generate experiences, and these experiences are never the same.**Edit: My part of the post was in contradiction with the quote, I fixed it thanks to a number of thoughtful comments.**
 
Survival Action Game in a Mech suit. [Concept] 
 Here's my idea for a game that wanted to do myself, but I currently have 2 projects running already.The  setup: The year is 3xxx, and the earth is pretty much a wasteland after  an invasion of insect like aliens. There are very little human survivor  bastions left. You, the protagonist belong to an intelligent unit, task  to seek out resources for survival and defending your bastion. Your  squad is a gatherer squad, equipped with a highly advanced Powersuit  like robot. Your suit, the gatherer suit is less performant in combat,  then a fighter suit, but the ai and sensoric/analytic functions are  topknoch. One day, while out on a mission to retreat the power cores of a fightersquad that got eliminated by  some epic battle, your team gets attacked, and all, but you and your  suit get eliminated.Gameplay:Goal: Far away from your bastion, and not enough energy to go back, you try to reach the safety of your bastion.The  twist: Your suit is your safe space. Nearly nothing can harm you while  in it. But you need to find food and water to survive. Inside your suit,  you have access to all your options, but everything costs energy. Want  to communicate with your ai? Costs energy Want to analyse the unknown plant you gathered? Costs energy. purify water to survive? Costs energy.Long range scans? lots of energy. Fly?  Tons of energy. So the gameplay is an energy management system, while  try to survive and get back home.Feel:  The idea is, that the player should feel an emotional attachment to  his/her suit, feeling save and highly capable while in the suit and very  helpless without. Problem is, the more options you use, the more energy  is used and the more the player will have to forfeit his options and  get closer to danger, and eventually have to rely on themself, when the  suit is out of energy (peak tension moments of the game). You can modify  the suit with modules you gather/build.And potentially even use other suits (like a combat suit sequence).challange for the dev:The AI of the mech suit. It should be very helpful, and should give the player the feeling of having a friend on his/her side. It needs to be sympathetic. It should feel bad, when you have to turn off communication to the AI, to save energy. it should make you feel lonely.&#x200B;I would do this in a topdown 2d Action game, but the concept can work in almost any setting and scale, even a Platformer game. 3d would have the most potential.
 
Applying the rest bonus philosophy to survival games 
Just dumping it here so that I don't forget about it, and maybe some dev somewhere wants to pick it up which I'm 100% for.Something that's consistently dragged survival games down is that, no matter how far you progress and how good your tech gets, you're always babysitting your player character as they whine that they're hungry and thirsty and sleepy. It's not particularly challenging but ignoring it means death, so it's really just a perpetual annoyance that makes a lot of survival games less fun.&#x200B;An alternative strategy is to add a levelling system to your survival game where xp is gained for your actions like crafting, fighting, exploring, etc. Instead of having hunger and thirst and tiredness kill you, give xp multipliers for staying well fed and rested, which will allow players to unlock things at a reasonable rate. This way, neglecting food will just cause your progress to stagnate instead of kill you, and stagnating is perfectly fine for endgame players that have everything.
 
Story-driven horror game - "The Program 
First I'd like to say I'm sorry for my English. Its not my first language.Plot: You, as a player, visit your grandma. She has Alzheimers disease. She already forgot almost everything but keeps remembering her favorite TV program from the 1940s. It's this classic family-like program about a small town in America. She tells you all about it. But then, as you leaving her home and riding through the country you see a small diner. You stop there to get some food and drink, but suddenly a man dressed in a fancy suit and a hat approaches you. He tells you he has some car trouble and asks if you could help him. You agree to come along and try to fix his car. He's delighted so he invites you to go this town and offers you a big reward. Thinking he's friendly and you don't really have that much money, you agree to get into his car. As he starts driving you notice he's driving you to an absolute nowhere. Soon there aren't any buildings, not even trees, just a long road. And then you are starting to see in "black/white". At first you think its something wrong with your eyes and you tell him you need to see a doctor. But he just keeps driving, silently, staring and sitting like a robot. Soon you are coming to that town and as soon as you see it. You feel disturbed. Because it looks exactly like the town from your grandma's tales. The rest of game delves into a storyline of you coming to town, getting to know the people. But then there's a hatch. The town in starting to feel disturbed and people even dissapear. You take the role of an investigator and figure out what is happening. Some people even start to "hunt" you because they think it's all your fault since everything started to go to hell ever since you appeared.I took inspiration for this mainly from "WandaVision" since i started watching that and listening to Everywhere At The End of Time by The Caretaker.
 
A Bunch of Half-Baked Ideas 
Over the years I've accumulated quite a few game ideas that I never developed very far, for any number of reasons. I don't claim that any of them are terribly original or haven't been done before. I've decided to just dump them here in case anyone wants to take a run at them. Without further ado:&#x200B;**Cloud Harvest** \- Consume clouds but don't consume too many or they won't grow back. Could replace clouds with trees or similar. Maybe add some special non-renewables. Environmental theme.&#x200B;**Feline Space Program** \- Manage a space program run by Internet cats. Cats have overrun the planet and are using humans to explore space – against their will. Humans say amusing things to their former pets as they are launched into space to accomplish certain goals. Game is a simple 2D space sim – what makes it stand apart is humor, and cats. Cat images are taken from the Internet and cropped accordingly, and a fishbowl helmet or other hats are placed on the images. The cats appear on screen to assign missions and provide commentary, or just insult their former owners. They have silly motives, like using the Moon as a giant litter box, or searching for the source of the elusive Red Bugs. Players can launch robot probes or capsules with human test pilots and have to complete randomly-assigned missions of increasing difficulty. “Boss” levels will involve especially challenging or significant story missions with feline astronauts. The player is presented with cartoon representations of the Earth and Moon. Controls are simple: you control a space gun on the surface of the Earth and can control angle and power. As you complete objectives, your gun becomes more powerful. Later levels will allow you to do limited mid-course corrections, simplified to a great degree (you might be able to perform a single correction of predetermined power and get to choose direction, or launch a landing craft from a mothership at the right time, however you would not be able to control the landing craft).&#x200B;**NetQuack** \- basically a duck-themed take on NetHack. Duck-based roguelike with procedurally-generated wetlands – duck ponds of various shapes and sizes joined by streams.Eat fish (either appear as silhouettes in the water or must be “duck-sensed” – like nethack search), find mates, defend against rivals, don’t get shot, avoid bears.Permadeath. Human predator shoots as you approach decoy indistinguishable from mate. Directional sound indicates direction of mate/decoy. May be several per level (wetland).Tile types: lily pads, reeds, tall grass, short grass, rock, water, logs, trees, boat.Predators: wolves, bears, foxes, big fish, “large aquatic predators”, humans, peregrine falcons&#x200B;**Simyphus (Sisyphus Simulator)** \- Push a boulder up a hill! Boulder rolls back down once it gets to the top. If you stop moving, the character will start to lean against the boulder with his/her back and it will start to push you back down – eventually you will no longer be able to hold it, and the boulder rolls back down. Stamina bar wears down as you push – stopping doesn’t use stamina, and you start with enough to make it to the top. Pushing up always uses stamina, so losing ground can mean not being able to make it to the top. Player is rewarded with demotivational quotes and new skins for boulders, new environments, all feature a slope and background. Slopes may vary slightly at random intervals and you will occasionally have to push the boulder over small rocks on the ground. You can never actually win the game, but you can continue to get achievements for sticking with it – meaningless tokens that don’t actually get you anywhere. Greater inclines require more stamina.Will have to run an algorithm to make sure the player always starts with enough stamina to reach the top, given solid determination (i.e., continually pushing against the boulder without sliding backwards.)Game is a commentary on the pointlessness of many tasks, including many games. A subtitle will intermittently taunt the player, asking them if they want a refreshing beverage, or berating them, telling them that it’s pointless, tell them they should take a break or otherwise badger. Of course the game won’t let you pause. And a mechanism prevents you from holding down the button with something, as it will spontaneously prompt you to press an alternate button to push. Holding down both buttons is the same as not pushing. Switches happen at random.&#x200B;**Suborbital** \- Manage a fleet of suborbital liners. Tank wars meets KSP. Atmospheric conditions affect target accuracy. Liners have acceleration thresholds that cannot be exceeded.&#x200B;**Troll Bait** \- You are a forum moderator/admin and must manage an internet forum. Keep the # of flame posts to a minimum. If the flame count gets too high, you will be removed by head admin. Use various tools to identify trolls. Some are obvious while others require sleuthing. But don’t take too long or the flame posts will reach critical mass.&#x200B;Edit: formatting, typosEdit 2: since some have expressed interest in using these ideas, I just wanted to add that if you do decide to run with an idea or part of one posted here, I would just ask that you let me see the results! I don't expect credit or compensation of any kind.
 
Play behind the scenes of a platformer 
The player is tasked with keeping testing chambers running while robots are being run through them. The player can push buttons and pull levers behind the scenes in order to stop floors from collapsing, rebuild tubes and wiring, and remove or rebuild dead robots. The player succeeds when a test subject makes it to the end of their room. Probably easiest as a 2d game.
 
PUBG x Boarding at the airport 
The game would be a multiplayer free-for-all.  There are 50 seats on the plane and 100 players with tickets, because, whoops, the flight has been "oversold".You all start at different entrances of the airport, equidistant from the gate.  (Although the gate might suddenly be changed from time to time just...because).  You have to get to the gate and get one of the few seats on the plane.  Additionally, there isn't enough overhead space on the flight for everyone, so only the first people to the plane will be able to bring their equipment along to the next flight. (more on that later)So everyone runs through the airport, you can pickup all kinds of weapons/items to fight your fellow passengers.  There's no death, you only get knocked down/stunned and lose valuable time if you're hit.  You can choose your starting class--e.g., you can have a stroller with a baby.  This slows you down but lets you use "priority" tunnels through the airport that other people can't, and makes a good ram for knocking other people over.  Also there would be a few of those internal airport cars you can try and grab, but obviously people will be fighting for those (watch out for "hop-ons" ;) ).  By playing you can "level up" your status (Priority/Gold/Star member/whatever) and get starting perks.When the plane is full it takes off, and lands at another airport where you have to make a "connection" to an even smaller plane, and so on, until one person gets in the very last plane (or maybe a helicopter).You can switch around or destroy the signs in the mazelike airport to confuse the other players.  I'm sure there's a way to incorporate TSA and baggage claim into the mechanics too.  The overall theme of the game is "everyone for themselves" and of course "#$@#$@ the airlines and their terrible airports" :)
 
Interdimensional FPS 
Essentially, I thought it would be cool if therr were a sci-fi FPS where you have to go back and forth or more ways between dimensions which co-exist in the same space, and to have a device that would shift objects or even parts of the world into a target dimension. Like use it on a chair to send it to an other dimensional space where you need the chair to reach somewhere.I also thought if it had a space setting, there could be areas where you're in a space station, and switching dimensions can't help because the other side only has empty space. Maybe a suit could let you survive that long enough to shift back.On planet surfaces, there could be structures and even geography that differ, so the player is exploring multiple worlds at once.I initially thought that there should be weapons that only work in this or that dimension, because the physics of those dimensions could hypothetically differ while a magic suit of plot armor protects the player's character from destabilization; but weapons might not be able to get such a treatment. It would complicate things, but maybe it would be appropriate for like some alien stuff to only work in their world until later on you get a new toy that unlocks usage in all dimensions.I thought it seemed like a kinda cool thing, but of course I'm never gonna make it :)
 
A game where the day restarts over and over again (like Groundhog Day) but you play as a different character every time. 
Let’s say there are about 20 - 30 characters and everyday after 12pm or if you die you restart the day and you are somebody else. From an office worker to a random high school student to the mayor to a hobo on the street. Your goal is pretty simple, solve a murder (or another mystery, maybe find out why this Groundhog Day thing is happening?) in a small town. You can interact with the other characters in dialogue and find clues as to what’s happening. You will have a journal that will transfer between characters but any other items will be gone. Certain characters have certain benefits and disadvantages like the mayor has access to more information or areas but he has more work to do before you can actually do stuff with him. When you play as the homeless guy you can move and do things the entire day but of course you start the day broke and with nothing.If I were to make it, it would be in a pixel art top down view.
 
A simulation game (like Zoo Tycoon?) where you have to manage conservation/ecology recovery plans for degraded lands 
Hello guys,First of all I want to ask you for mercy with my English, I am from Brazil and it is'nt my first language.->CONCEPTIt is a simulation game with resources management and decision making where you receave missions to successfully apply restore or conservation strategies in diferents degraded places with diferents challenges.-history isn't a thing in my view for it but feel free to work in it.- It could work well with procedural programming for places or missions.- Graphics shouldn't be a key caracterisc.- Multiplayer could work with a free-for-all 8x but with competition for stabilizing ecosystems functions in the shorter time.->WHY THIS THEME?Well, it isn't new to everyone that we are walking to huge global changes that have been developed as a feedback from the human development. environmental changes and human transportation of exotic species had lead to a increasing in alterations on ecosystems all around the world, some of them, can't naturaly recovery for them historically state.This game can be a huge opportunity to call attention of the new generations to the impacts of the actual human way of living. If well build, I could be use in classes for interactive ways of teaching ecology.->HOW IT COULD WORK?Played has it's own office with of workers that have diferents classes corresponding for diferents areas of work:GeologistHerpetologistInsectologist Water specialistMammals specialistEtc...Every mission has a prompt day, budget to use and a informative of the place and the characteristics of it besides a historical state (species composition and abiotic caracteriscs) that he need to archive.-> SOME GAME REFERENCES THAT COULD WORK- Zoo Tycoon / RollerCoaster Tycoon- Game Dev Tycoon- SimCity- Papers, Please- Age of Empires?-> SOME PAPERS REFERENCES FOR ECOLOGY AND RESTORATION- HOBBS, Richard J.; HIGGS, Eric; HARRIS, James A.

RPG Core Mechanic Concept - No levels or Classes 
Hi all,I've been contemplating this RPG Mechanic Concept for a while due to my love of RPG's where you aren't boxed into a class and can just choose to play the game your own way. I hope I'm able to articulate it the way I envision it in my head.So, first up, everyone enters the world with the same stats and no proficiency in anything. Equiping gear and items gives you penalties and buffs to your particular stats, as well as sets a growth threshold. As you wear that armor more often, or keep swinging that sword, the penalties get less and the buffs get better, while your core stats also trend upwards towards the threshold. Let's use that example above and focus on say just a strength attribute. You're a new player and you pick up some metal armor and a two-handed sword. You have a strength of 10 and this setup requires 20 strength. The newly equipped gear gives you a x0.5 multiplier on damage and armor value until you get accustom to the new gear. Your base stats slowly increase as you get more proficient with the gear until eventually the multiplier is at x1.0. Now your base strength is 20. Something like that. Gear that you become familiar with, such as this sword and armor, might continue to grow in strength up to x1.2 or x1.5 or beyond to indicate your mastery and how familiar with that gear you are.Essentially, the idea is having stat growth linked to the way that you play and your choices in gear selection. The reason behind it is to get people attached to "that specific bit of gear" and to have new gear choices, which are upgrades in the long run, provide a hinderance when first acquired to reflect getting used to moving in that new armor, or the weight of that new weapon. This is overly simplified for the purpose of starting conversation, but would be happy to discuss with people further if anyone wants more detail or wants to build on the concept.Also, I'm not a game dev, just a fan.
 
A reverse of normal escort missions: You're trying to get yourself killed while an NPC is protecting you. 
 
CHARGE! - a flag bearer simulator 
CHARGE! is 2-D platformer where the player controls the flag or standard bearer in a historical (read it as old-timey) battle. As the flag bearer, the player inspires his soldiers and carries the momentum of battle but at great personal risk to his own life, as he becomes a priority target for the enemy. Your initial weapon is the flag itself but with glory points (earned by making kills with the flag), you can unlock other weapons to bring into the fight. Before the onset of each battle, you can choose your loadout and apply any upgrades you've earned from previous fights. The battle starts off far away and plays like an avoidance/dodge game as you have to dodge enemy fire, but as you charge into the enemy lines, the screen zooms and focuses in on you and your enemies' frontlines, until the game pretty much plays like a brawler/hack n' slash. The terrain is different across maps (procedurally generated?) and affects the speed of your advance (slower uphill, for instance) and what kind of cover (ex. shrubs, trees, boulders, battlefield wreckage) is available. Cover has to be used strategically because the longer you stay covered, the more likely you are to be pinned down and the resolve of your troops diminishes as they start taking on casualties.Some ideas of upgrades/weapons:* Flag size upgrade = slows your movement speed but increases the amount of glory earned as you run.* Brighter colors = same as flag size upgrade but no penalty on speed. Much more glory cost however.* Spear point = Upgrades the point on the end of your flag pole to various spear/bayonet-like type weapons.*  Sidearm/secondary weapon = If your flag is small enough, you may carry a sidearm/secondary weapon to help deal with tougher foes at the front* Back harness (very expensive) = allows you to carry the flag with free hands (allows you to equip a two-handed secondary weapon). Glory earned only from running however, since not having the flag in hand means you can't make flag kills.* Bounce = faster recovery when thrown by an explosion* Mounts (e.g. horse) = faster movement speed but makes you a bigger target. You can also be thrown off your mount if the mount is shot or spooked by an explosion. Mounts may be upgradeable and may have their own mini-skill tree.* Upgrades for thrust, slash, crush/bludge attacks with flag.For controls, I'm thinking of arrow keys for movement and letter keys for fighting combos.
 
A mechanic I want to see for Assassin's Creed. 
Just to note, I'm not the biggest fan of Assassin's Creed, just thought of something that would greatly improve those games.What I'd call organic map exploration, no more towers to reveal the map, basically you'd have a radius around your character that would reveal the fog of war as you ran around, but the radius would increase as you climbed higher, to simulate your character being able to see more. You'd still have the incentive to climb to these high points, just without it being a necessary glorified collectible.
 
For all the Legend of Korra fans, a Pro-Bending VR game where you can play against other players 
Each match takes 6 players, each player is assigned an element, and two teams face off against each other, using their bending to battle opponents back in the arena. With motion controls, bending could be a blast, and the pro-bending tournament setting could create an addictive multiplayer loop
 
Post post apocalyptic game 
A game where society has already rebuilt in the aftermath of an apocalypse, but they didn’t ever fix the thing that caused it in the first place.You could find out what caused it last time at the beginning, and slowly uncover that it’s still there.I have no idea how you would implement this game. I thought y’all might have some ideas.
 
5v5 CQB Shooter, Each Team Has a Commander 
Essentially the gameplay is a CQB shooter, similar to CS:GO or R6S.However, each team has a commander that is spectating and calling the shots.The commander can:\+ See first person view of their soldiers through helmet cam.\+ Monitor certain security video feeds that their soldiers cannot see.\+ Hack certain systems, suck as automatic doors, lights, alarms or even hack the opposing commanders system.The commanders role is very similar to the mastermind in Resident Evil: Resistance.This makes the 5 soldiers truly feel like soldiers as their job isn't so much to think as it is to take orders and utilize quick reactions. The commander has a stressful responsibility to protect and guide their soldiers and take full responsibility for a mission failure.

African GTA 
Imagine living all gangster, like you're in America. But you're in the ghetto of high-rise cities in Africa. We have heavy political satire, where people are let down their entire lives. People dying due to unreliable healthcare and poor children and adults on the outskirts of the cities in shanty towns. Terrorists are now part of the situation; and so are soldiers because of political unrest. Despite all of this on the other end are the people living rich from exploitation of workers who work for peanuts to support families. These are people living in beautiful parts of the city with illuminated lights and have houses that no-one would imagine. They don't use hospitals in Africa - they go abroad. Then there's sex workers - women who will not take a second thought at giving up their bodies to feed their families. Alternatively they're those who live abroad and come to start their businesses which always seem to make massive profits. With 10+ cars well over a million dollars each and others who are actually living in the middle class - making up 30% of the population. Very little rich people and over 60% unemployed poor people forming gangs and attacking (killing) those who aren't from the same country as them. Setting: Fictional Name For African Country, based off South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and other elements of various African countries.Ok, now we have the rough settings and lore. You are a foreigner in the country coming here for university studies. Long story short, university is attacked by terrorists, there's some civil unrest and you end up doing jobs for people to learn a living. These include gangs, military, government (separate from military) and rich people. The game will involve some elements of satirical pain, when your girlfriend dies due to poor healthcare. Oh and lets not forget about the abundant access to melee weapons. Here guns are used a lot, but lets not forget the common man, having knives in their socks or blatantly walking around with cutlasses and work tools. Ascending from nothing to big-time would really be seen here. You start off as a student on campus which closes down and then go to shanty, then manageable, and then middle-class, until you live rich! Political leaders even send you on missions to make sure the elections are rigged.&#x200B;Main mission of the game is to make sure the government remains as leaders or join opposition parties in a coup. Keep off the terrorists or go head on. Or just get to the top of the ladder and end it there.P.S I'm from Africa, so this is just my experience living here my whole life and an attempt to convey what really goes down.
 
A fantasy fishing game where you fish bigger and crazier creatures the better you get 
I've wanted to play this game for a LONG, long time. Nothing quite scratches the itch I imagine this game would scratch.As the title explains, you're a budding fisherman with a shitty stick rod and a rotting wooden boat. When you start fishing, you can't really go too deep or catch anything too big without it being next to impossible to catch, but the more you catch, the more you can sell to the local vendor, the more you can upgrade your rod, your boat, your equipment, and consumables that give you buffs. You start by only really being able to catch goldfish and garbage, but eventually, you will progress to the point where you are able to catch huge lovecraftian sea creatures and other unreal shit.Night fishing is a different ballpark, the fish become significantly harder and more creepy, you get huge glow in the dark anglers, evil looking octopuses, stuff like that. They give significantly more $$$ and XP for catching, at the downside that you'll have stamina debuffs from not sleeping.That's right, you need to keep your stamina up by eating some of the fish you catch! When you catch a fish, you get three options; eat it for rare buffs & stamina gains, sell it to the vendor for money, or use it as bait for a better chance at catching rarer fish.Catching fish would be like from a POV perspective. As you cast the rod, your camera follows the bobber as it goes deeper into the ocean. The better rod you have, the deeper you can go, the faster you can go, the more hits you can take from other fish before your rod velocity reaches 0, the better rods you can steer them or explode fish in your way, other stuff like that. When you attract a fish, you have to do a QTE as soon as the fish bites which activates the bobber in different ways. The regular ones will just be you pulling them back up, but the more upgraded bobbers might eject spikes into the fish's mouth to impale them, or deploy a huge net around them. These have different advantages and negatives to using for different fish. Once you've caught the fish you need to spam spacebar (you can buy upgrades that automate this later) to reel your fish in. You move your mouse counter to whatever direction the fish is struggling in, and maybe do other shit too. The bigger fish are REALLY furious and it takes a lot of accuracy and hard work to catch. But when you catch it, it flies into the air and you get a satisfying screen that tells you how big the fish is and its name. There's a logbook that will log each fish you catch, tell you a bit about it, and generally shows sillhouettes of all the fish you haven't yet caught. You get XP for catching fish. The more XP, the better you get. You can put your upgrade points into strength (makes counter-steering fish easier), perception (gives you more slowdown time), stamina (lets you catch more fish before you need to sleep), stuff like that. The vendors sell better rod upgrades, cooler boats, better apparel (small buffs but mainly to make you look cool), some low-level bait, consumable items that give you buffs, etc. The more money you put into the local shops, the better stuff you get. Vendors also have a quest board where you can fulfil bounties and timed catch requests for money.The endgame is catching a huge, cthulu-tier sea creature at night. This thing should be insane, and if you catch it, you get 3 options:1. You sell the fish to the vendors. They're so impressed that they sell everything to you for the fish, you become a capitalist success and make your own fishing lodge for new fishers. The end.2. You eat the fish and it imbues you with godlike fish powers, and you ascend to become a fish GOD (like the slug ending in bloodborne yo)3. You use the fish as BAIT. This unlocks NG+. As you reach the bottom of the ocean with the fish as bait, the sea floor opens up, and you get pulled straight into the wormhole from your rod. This is some castlevania symphony of the night type shit. You enter a mirror world where all of the fish are fucking INSANE CORRUPTED VERSIONS of what you already caught. The vendors are all undead fish people, and you can breathe underwater. You become the bait, and you have to jump into the ocean and FUCKING FIGHT THE FISH you're trying to catch, god of war type shit.So yeah, that's all i've got. I wish a game like this existed.
 
An Isometric RPG where you play as an inmate in an intergalactic prison-ship 
Think Sci-fi prison break, except the prison is the most dangerous society known on any galaxy. You play as a new inmate who must find a way to survive.You basically have to form connections with people/groups of different kinds and species, while conforming to the prison schedule. Everything you do is being watched, so the player must be careful what they d lo and where they do it.
 
A golf game, but in a zombie apocalypse world. You have guns and golf clubs. 
Fend off approaching zombies to get your golf shot off. The closer the zombies get, the harder it is to hit the golf ball the way you want, because you get scared and shake more with decreased distance between you and the zombies.You can shoot the zombies, set traps, or hit them with your clubs if they get close enough.
 
A mining game where the only way to mine is through explosives 
In case there’s another game like this and I haven’t done enough google searches, please understand that I have no idea if this concept has been done before....The gameplay would be similar to Terraria, with the exception that the only way to break blocks is through mining. Players play in teams of 3, working together to bring back coal to trading companies. All resources, coal or otherwise, must be placed in a minecart that one team member pushes, or else all resources on you are lost upon death (and no, other players can’t pick up these resources). The minecart also acts as a crafting station; along the way you’ll encounter different ores, which allow you to craft dynamite with different abilities (examples include dynamite packs that have larger radius but must be placed instead of thrown, and remote-activated dynamite that remains dormant until triggered by a detonator). At the end of the day, the more coal you receive, the more money you gain in the end, which can then be spent on upgrades or cosmetics. You’ll also encounter traps and enemies, the latter of which can be damaged and killed through dynamite. These enemies can drop rare resources which can then be used for more exotic dynamite.
 
Soviet Corpse Manager 
**Genre:** Arcade (unrealistic) management simulator.**Name:** I imagine the title would be **Soviet Corpse Manager**, but the in-game title screen would have something like the following title.#People's Workplace Hazard Director##Story / ObjectiveThe beautiful southern nation of Paraguay has elected to give socialism a try. Dictator Galeano's five-year plan has decided to invest heavily in the unobtainium industry. This industry has a notorious and irreparable high workplace death rate, but the people of Sovoguay are willing to do anything *for the motherland*. Which is socialist rhetoric for "or else".The gloriously efficient Sovoguayan government is able to replace any dead workers nearly instantly, but workers nearly always die in a position that prevents further use of the workstation. Which is why there was instituted the People's Workplace Hazard Ministry (MRTP), which is the industrial corpse-removal arm. Your job as a MRTP director is to make sure that dead workers are replaced quickly enough to maintain production quotas. If you cannot, your employment will be *terminated*.##Gameplay##You oversee a large factory. There are two kinds of employees in this factory: *workers* and *functionaries*.The *workers* are the factory workers, who will autonomously work their jobs. They will also frequently die while doing so. The factory is large enough that the average worker can survive for some days, but there are still a couple of deaths per real-time minute. You have no control over the workers.The *functionaries* are employees of the MRTP. Their job is to carry corpses out from of their workstations when an employee dies. They will not move without being told, and you must give them the task to carry any corpses you see on the factory.You will notice corpses by the fact that they stopped working, along with death animations if you can catch them happening. Then you will click on a functionary (or two of them, if the dead worker is too fat, which is rare) and on the dead worker, and they will carry it away and escort his/her replacement to the workstation.You will also have a standard-issue **rifle**, with which you can shoot any people you see on the factory. Usually this is counter-productive, since it only means more corpses to manage. However, this is the only known *treatment* in Sovoguay for certain *behavioural illnesses* (status conditions) which your functionaries and workers can get. Some of those are:- **Chronic Slowness:** Functionaries with this condition will work slower than normal. You will have to watch their moving animation to notice. They also have a chance (25%, say) to pass on this condition to the replacement workers they bring to the stations.- **Ancient Jewish Priesthood:** Functionaries with this condition will not touch any corpses directly, because they must maintain Jewish ritual purity. They are easy to notice, therefore, because they fail to follow orders. However, not so much in the later levels, when you may have the aid of *forklifts* to carry the corpses. They will drive those forklifts without issue, but you may still notice them because they will also fail to work at all on the Sabbath.- **Right Wing Rebellious Ideology:** These counter-revolutionary infiltrates wish to dismantle the Sovoguayan dictatorship and bring back the old Paraguayan government. They will work as normal, but any workers they replace will start sabotaging the workplace. You will notice rebellious workers because their working animation plays backwards from normal. You can only notice rebellious functionaries through the fact that the workers they replace are rebellious.Game play will get harder as the game progresses. Workers will die more in certain seasons because of famine and plague, and quotas will increase. There may be a **mission mode** with increasingly harder objectives to meet, and also an **arcade mode**, in which you must try to survive as long as you can in your job, as quotas increase over time and conditions get harder.
 
Any horror game ideas? 
I am currently developing a small horror game on UE4, with some inspiration of PT. I am looking for ideas for the plot and story, as well as some horror events and occurrences. I am totally open for some ideas! The game is physiological, and the setting and atmosphere is dark and unnerving. Paranormal events take place while you navigate the house (radio turns on, footsteps, candles blow out, writing on the walls, grudge noises, etc). I could really use some more mechanics or paranormal events, but I need to develop story. Give me ideas!!!
 
A chess game where every time you move, that piece is changed into a different piece 
If you moved a pawn it could change into a Knight, queen, rook, etc. and it works that way for every piece The only exception is the king. The king can’t change and nothing can change into a king. If you make it a credit would be nice
 
A horror game that switches between attacking real life sequences and defenceless dream sequences 
I don’t know
 
A post-apocalypse game in which you hunt sea monsters 
A strange mix of Assassin's Creed: black flag and Shadow of the Colossus. In the future, sea levels have risen and most of the world is covered in ocean, with only small regions of dry land left. Most sea creatures have adapted or mutated into huge beasts, and you have to roam the seas in your upgradable ship and hunt (or run away) from them.  Interesting features could include:- Customisable ship, crew, weapons and outfits- Massive, horrifying and beautiful monsters with interesting behaviours (not always hostile) and weaknesses/attacks- Trade posts and taverns and stuff on dry land, as well as cities.- A mix of 17th century and futuristic technology- Multiplayer to go hunting with your mates, or fight other players in ship battles
 
Using real-world steps as in-game currency or steps in a battle royale game 
Imagine Fortnite or COD Warzone, but you have to move around in the real world to accumulate points that you spend moving around in the game. It would be used for anything, really. For example, instead of mining resources in a Starcraft-style RTS game, you’d have to go run or walk a few kilometers. Maybe there could be a pace element to it, like a multiplier for getting X number of steps in Y minutes gets you 2X in-game movement points. It would be tracked through a smartphone companion app that could be synched with fitness tracker apps or other step counters.UPDATE: In addition to a pace multiplier, there could be a streak multiplier, where the app could establish a baseline and detect periods of increased step activity (eg workouts, walking to work instead of automobile, etc) and award bonus step points based on days in a row with detectable increased activity.
 
The starving child 
Literally based on a dream I had, I have very little experience with gaming or making games.The starved childA horror game about a child who's been locked in his room for so long by his parents that he literally will eat anything that movesYou're a small character (you could be a sentient rat, mouse, cockroach or something - I'm not sure what I was in my dream lol) and the aim is to get out of his room without being eaten by him. You can knock things over to distract him, sacrifice other already dead bugs or mice you find to him ect, and the only way he can detect you is by sight or noise so you have to stay quiet and hidden as possible. Kinda like hello neighbour but morbidly depressing.Anyways that's it lmao.
 
A 4-player party game about trying to beat your friends to the punch for powerups, often with disastrous results. 
Players control animals in other animal costumes (e.g. a chicken in a cow costume) through a gauntlet of quirky mini-games to get the highest score. However, the core gimmick of the game is its "Quick Draw" events:Every so often the current mini-game will pause and, after a short countdown, a random powerup will flash on-screen. The first player to press a button on their controller will steal and keep that powerfup for the remainder of the entire match.**The catch is:** Almost half of those powerups are *gag* powerups that make things worse. They're wacky debuffs. For example, one might set you on fire so now you're a little bit faster but you also can't stop moving. Like... ever. The result is that players become torn between wanting to be quickest at nabbing a powerup and wanting to carefully consider the powerup they'd be stealing.****That was only one kind of Quick Draw event. There are more.Another Quick Draw event displays four powerups in order *before* the countdown timer starts. Once able, the first person to press a button gets the first powerup, the second to press gets the second powerup, etc. Depending on the powerups and their order, you might want to be the first to press your button but would hate to be a split second to late and end up with the second. If nobody is pressing buttons, either fake sounds will play to trick players into pressing or the items will reshuffle without warning.Half of the fun is players doing otherwise straightforward mini-games while dealing with a nonstop stacking buffs and debuffs. You might have earned yourself a "sticky" powerup that prevented you from sliding/skidding during the Thin Ice Tricycle Race, but now it's making you slower during the Potato Sack Slide... and now you got the dreaded "hiccup" buff that presses a random input on your controller at the worst times (even during Quick Draws).
 
A Dune inspired. Desert survival game. 
(obviously nothing alike with dune, other than the desert setting and Sandworm) You start out in a cave with almost no recollection of who you are, or where you came from. You eventually have to get yourself out of that cave, by either mining out, or climbing out, but once you do, that was just the first step. After leaving the cave, you escape into a Vast, Huge, Saharan like desert, that almost looks infinite. The game wont tell you much, other than some hints with wind direction to the closest little outskirt town. (like the game mechanic from Ghost of Tsushima) Once you arrive to that town, (the only town in the game) You notice a variety of people, including traders, bounty hunters, butchers, shop owners, and a lively town. You ask around the little area, for details of where you are, and over time you learn about the Sand Worm, or some sort of Monster, that lurks these Dunes. Over time in the game, you explore the vast land, and see many different encounters, of learning, surviving, and dominating. Obviously this game would be first person, and if it could be made, the Sand Worm fight, could be amazing. What do you guys think of something like this?
 
Does anyone have any ideas for a simple game? 
I kinda want to make a simple game over fall break but I can't think of anything. Does anyone have any ideas?
 
FPS but you play as a Photographer 
Typical 3d FPS game where you play as a photographer carrying your only weapon: a camera.Goal: To capture photos of your opponents as much as you can for a given time.Gameplay:1. You can move around, side step, roll, jump, crawl, swim (w/o damaging the camera), and pick/throw/use various objects in the environment.2. You cannot capture photos when you are carrying an item unless the camera lets you. You are forced to stop for a very short moment when you are capturing photos.3. Photos will be evaluated after the given time. Capturing your enemy unaware will give more points. Capturing multiple enemies in a single photo gives more points.4. Each team will wear a marker that can be worn in any part of the body except for the feet. if the marker does not appear in the captured photo, it will not count as a point unless the enemy's face is visible.5. You can either look thru the camera's viewfinder or at the LCD display to check the accuracy of your photos. Focusing and fixing the blur will improve your points.6. Your hands can have different controls. You can extend your arm up, down, sides, to your back or while hiding.7. Bird's eye view and worm's eye view gives plus points. Selfies with your enemy gives enormous points, Selfies with only yourself gives negative points.8. Your camera's shutter has cooldown. You cannot simply capture multiple photos at a single instance unless your camera lets you.9. You will have to turn your flash on to capture photos in the dark. You cannot capture underwater unless your camera lets you.10. Extra missions can also be given for every game which yields bonus points i.e. this blue bird, 3 pigs in a single photo, this npc with your enemy, this item inside a garbage bin.Long post! Thank you for reading.
 
You wake up on the morning of the apocalypse in a remote rural town and have to survive increasingly crazy events. When you die it resets but the longer you survive the more time you have to prepare before it kicks off... 
Prep time would be a UI allowing you to select your 'loadout' and 'upgrade' your character-e.g survive 3 days and wake up a day earlier- go buy supplies from local hardware store/supermarket  survive a week and you've got time for some internet shopping  survive a couple of weeks and take a survival course with the local rangersYou would also be able to unlock upgrades through exploration and learning-Find winning lottery numbers written down to have more cash to spend  Locate storage units to rent them and fill them with supplies to unlock storage caches  Die to radiation on day30 so go back and order a hazmat suitAs you prepare more and gain more money to do so, options to invest in local businesses come about allowing the hardware store to stock chainsaws and augers instead of hatches and pickaxes. There would be options to invest in yourself (new skills, better stats ect) or the world around you (better loot, safehouses) as well as making purchases (starting gear and supplies).  Events would start off easy(ish) then get progressively worse:  Power cuts -> panic/looting/fires/murder -> lowland flooding -> extreme temps -> bandits -> animals going crazy -> lightning storms -> earthquakes/landslides -> volcanoes and earthfire -> volcanic winterIdeally there would be different routes to survive- like becoming a fully kitted out survival expert or investing heavily into local infrastructure, make a shit tonne of money and build a bunker in the mountains.   In order to prevent repetition safe houses once discovered, unlocked and filled with supplies would allow you to 'fast forward' a few days (though trying to wait out volcanoes and earthfire in a logcabin wouldnt work for obvious reasons).  Overtime parts of the map are lost to flooding/ sinkholes/ fires etc meaning you have to prioritize exploration and have time limits to loot certain areas (small coastal town would get flooded after a week or so).  I think this could be a really fun idea! You could even have it so that as you progress you start in different areas going from living in a small apartment to either a survival/hunting cabin or a decked out mansion. Eventually you would overcome all the crazy events, hold out through the (short) volcanic winter and survive the apocalypse.
 
A survival game, but it revolves around your journal 
So I was watching videos of survival games and journaling tips and such, just because, and I remembered this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/jitba3/a\_survival\_game\_where\_you\_name\_everything/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/jitba3/a_survival_game_where_you_name_everything/)Combining all of these, I came up with this idea:Like any other survival game, but you have a journal that you used to, well, journal, prior to the crash, accident etc. After the events that brought you to survival, you use the remaining pages of your journal for survival AKA taking notes, making discoveries, writing down crafting ideas or any survival ideas, your condition and so on.The game would start with one of multiple reasons you're here e.g. plane, car, train, ship. After that, the equipment you'll have is like 1 or 2 minimal survival equipment, which is randomized, but every game you'll always have your journal. As you start, there's already some survival notes written in it, as in you scribbled some quick thoughts into it that may help your survival (a kind of a tutorial). As your progress through the game, the journal will fill with notes of various things: from crafting recipes to thoughts, that hint to some thing that could progress the game. Every games journal in different, as you experience and find new and different things, so will the journal fill with notes differently; to get two same journals is pretty rare.The ultimate goal altogether is to survive and come out alive.But I mentioned that you'll use the last pages of journal; that's because 2/3 of it is filled with thought and entries that could portray the kind of person the character is you play as. But it isn't always the same. It's always different for every game (as "always" goes with games). One or a team is not enough to write enough entries, so people who have bought the game could go on the game's website, prove their purchase and are permitted to a page, where you and other people can write stories, then comment and vote for them. by the end of the month, the most voted story is implemented into the game. A moderation team is in place to disqualify stories that could be described as, *"very, very wrong"*
 
This sound fun 
 
A Circus Tycoon management game where you manage a wandering Carnival...run by assassins 
>You manage a circus where your performers are all secretly assassin's and gain contracts by attracting people with carnivals. (Don't worry, you don't have to kill your customers...mostly)>Manage a carnival by day, by night send your performers as undercover killers into turn based, Isometric stealth levels. >You start out with a basic crew and basic buildings for making a carnival. Overtime by earning money for contracts, you can expand your business, gain new members and build new attractions (like Ferris Wheels and Haunted Houses) Your circus needs attractions to being in crowds and also contracts. Selecting the best performers to feature as the "main attraction" gives bonus perks and maximum customers.
 
Making a heist game, what is missing from current gen heists? 
I'm working on a top down sci fi heist game that plays a little like payday 2, along with some randomly generated bases to raid.I haven't seen a good heist game in a while, what would be some new ideas or things that would be cool to include in a game like this?
 
Foraging Simulator 
I want to spawn in the forest with basic gardening tools. I want to learn where to look for certain plants when I forage, their names, effects, if their edible etc I also think it'd be fun to make recipes like teas, healing aloe balms etc. You could get crazy realistic and informative with it if you wanted to and I would be all here for it. I would like to be able to actually harvest, make cuttings and plant them at my cottage or grow a whole new food forest that's made up of native flora and is cohesive with the animal life.
 
Wild animal simulator 
Basically, a game where you spawn as a random animal in an ecosystem, lets say African Savanna, and must play until death. Its multiplayer.So for example in the Savanna case you spawn as a Zebra and are teamed up with other players who also spawned as Zebras, you must defend yourselves for as long as possible against lion/hyena players while traveling, eating grass and protecting the young. You can not pick what you respawn as, its always random.The available animals would be varied, so you could spawn as one of those birds that use bigger hervibores as transportation or as a meerkat or something. Once you hit a set time limit you keel over and die a natural death.
 
Walmart Simulator 
You have to navigate a cart through an increasingly busier store (3d, AI filled environment) to finish a list to shop for.  Watch as old ladies stop in front of you..little kids go running by, restockers blocking the way,  and wierdos try and slow down your race to finish on time.If youre not carefull, too many collisions with customers or knocking down products (without picking them back up) will have the manager called on you and the level is failed.As the levels progress, the list becomes longer and the store is busier.  Eventually, you will have to restort on memory as the shopping list is unavailable, or got wet and slowly fades away.  At the final few levels, the shopping cart gets wonkier and is harder to steer.  Get 100% on all levels to unlock the motor cart to play the bonus levels (beep beep!)
 
Game idea for two people, to make a game in a few days 
Hi !I'm good with Blender, my friend is good with Unity and we thought we could try to make a game together in a few days, like a game jam but without a strict time limit. We would do this around christmas and since he works and I have exams, we will mostly do the game on evenings and weekends.I'm thinking about something not AAA obviously. I can do graphics similar to the legend of zelda on nintendo DS and I don't really know what my friend's truly able to do on Unity but as long as it doesn't require an engineer degree or a thousand of different APIs or whatever, we should manage.So, any ideas ?
 
Groundhog Day in Ancient Pompeii (game idea) 
You are a citizen of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. You wake up on October 23rd A.D 79 from a terrible dream of fire and ash, a premonition of impending doom. You have one day to warn the townspeople and get them to safety before Mount Vesuvius erupts. The day is spent wandering around the open-world streets and squares of the city, into tabernae, public baths, aristocratic houses, markets, the theatre, the gladiators gym and more. You try (or not) to convince friends, family, lovers, famous citizens or even random strangers that the end is nigh. Though most dismiss you as a madman, your interactions with people have strange and unpredictable consequences for how their final day is spent.You can play Cupid for some star-crossed lovers, murder rivals, throw a wild bacchanalian party, participate in political intrigue, induce mass hysteria, impersonate religious leaders, seduce your hot neighbour, steal priceless treasure, carve cryptic or slanderous graffiti around town, ensure the survival of some characters while erasing others forever or simply fill the temple of Venus with hundreds of cheese wheels. Finally the volcano erupts blanketing the whole town in a thick, preservative dust. The screen goes black.....scratch, scratch, swish, swish. It’s the sound of an archaeologists brush, meticulously uncovering the city and people of Pompeii, frozen in time. Key characters fates are revealed as the archaeologists notes scrawled across the screen detail who was found where, doing what, with whom. The archaeologists make assumptions about Roman culture and society based on the evidence you leave behind (cheese wheels a sacred symbol of love and beauty?) Survivors of the eruption may go on to have far reaching influence on world events. History becomes the epilogue to your Groundhog Day in Ancient Pompeii. Suddenly a rooster crows, and you wake up with a start. You’re back in your bed in Pompeii on the 23rd of October, 79 A.D. Maybe this time you’ll figure out how to save the whole town.
 
RPG Idea 
What if there was a turn-based RPG set during the 70s disco era and idk ur in like a disco group and those are the members of your party but some supernatural shit happens idk i don't have a full story figured out but yeah a disco-era rpg would be cool
 
A video game where all of the NPCs utilize chatbot API to interact with the player and other NPCs 
 It would be an ordeal to program, but I believe it could be done. Parameters could be set so that certain NPCs will talk about plot-centric details, but not for all of them, so you could have side quest NPCs and main quest NPCs.
 
I didn't think about the story at first and now I'm stuck 
I recently got into game development and right off the bat i made the biggest mistake of my career and that was not planning things ahead, now I'm stuck in the development not knowing what to do with the story so i want ur help.Things that i have done so far:I've made a 2 floor apartment with bedroom and kitchen and hallways and with all the necessary assets like furniture, tv, bed, desks etc..I've also made a character with all the necessary functionality for scary games like being able to inspect things, having flashlight, a glow stick and opening doors and Drawers and all that stuff.My own idea for story was something similar to the movie ring with the creepy girl crawling on the floor but after getting into modeling i realized with my skills it's not possible to model a detailed character like that as animating is hard and i don't have the necessary skills to do it. So i wanna do something more simple and doable.If u guys have any ideas that can help me please share it as I've been stuck in the development for a long time thanks.
 
Looking for Ideas for a game where you play as a traveling merchant 
So, my plan for this game is that you're more of a nomadic merchant. This means that you'll always be on the move instead of settled in one spot.For travel you would have to tame an animal. As the game goes on you might can tame different animals for different things. Right now though I'm thinking that the player will only have the one primary tame.What all the player will sell? I'm not sure. What the story will be? I'm not sure either.I have some broad ideas but nothing fully developed. Any ideas?
 
A 2D platformer/shooter where you have one comically sized bullet that controls gravity 
So I’m about to start my adventure of game design and I was wondering what you guys thought of my first idea. Basically you have a 2D platformer full of enemies that you must kill with one reusable bullet that can control gravity.The two main abilities will be pulling the bullet towards you and pulling stuff towards the bullet. For example, shoot something then press a button to pull the bullet back and reload, or shoot something at something then pull yourself too the bullet and retrieve it from the enemy’s body.Then there will be other abilities branching out from that. Like pulling the bullet out of an enemy will cause them to start bleeding, or pulling yourself towards the bullet will make you punch and stun the enemy.I don’t have a name yet but I do have a rough step by step plan for it’s development. Also it’s a 2D pixel art platformer because I don’t want my first game to be focused on graphics.
 
A dating sim where you are the most popular guy in school, and romance is TOO easy, but you have horrible, unceasing gas. 「Breezy Days at Legume High」 
You play as Lance Flatch, a junior at Lugume Preparatory High School. Experience the life of an impossibly hunky tennis player with swarms of girls that hang on his every word and who dream of being his one and only. ♥Because you have just recently transferred from another school, everyone is curious to get to know you, and the feeling is mutual as so many of these young ladies are impossibly cute and interesting! Even after just a week since arriving, you’ve managed to get to know many girls between classes. There’s only one *bulging* problem. Stress from changing schools has left you with indigestion so extraordinary the doctors have diagnosed you with 30-day Perpetual Tract Harnessing of Fume Laden Rectal Release Periods Resulting in Transcendently Humid Recharging Winds Sudden Spray Syndrome. (Pthflrrprthrwsss for short).In order to get through this month-long time period, you are going to have to strategically pass gas at carefully chosen times and places so as to not completely blast your social life to oblivion. When you start a file, you randomly know 8 of the 16 girls who are interested in you and some of their characteristics, but you will have to meet the rest of the cast by choice because they have the “initially reluctant” trait. The game is over in a month though, so you shouldn’t wait too long. However, waiting can be beneficial if the girl you want to be with has fewer opportunities to get rump rumbled by you.GAMEPLAY: FARTING (Dealing with Pthflrrprthrwsss doesn’t have to be devastating. Ask your doctor and take back your social life!) Of course there are many dialog options, gift decisions, and scheduling tasks to make in this dating sim, yet for all this, farting is the bread and butt of gameplay. A gut barometer at the top of the screen shows at all times how much air pressure has built up. Flatulence steadily increases throughout the day and must be dealt (with).First and foremost, the **space bar** is what manually breaks wind. Hold it down and let the world deal with the consequences. This always makes noise. Tap space rapidly to let it rip at a level that any character in the vicinity will detect regardless of their traits (see traits below). This is MaxPassage™ mode and is most commonly used when you get home from school right before some girl knocks on the door to ask you out on the spot. Strategic releases can propel you forward in your goals.Next, the **shift** key “shifts” your posterior position so that gasses escape silently. It doesn’t always work, and you need to lightly tap shift to check what it sounds like. If it squeals stop immediately and wait a moment. Silent shifts will always scream eventually, though. When that happens you’ll have to wait a bit before it can be used effective again. The **control** key is the final tool… under your belt. With this, you control your air so that it can’t be released. This almost always works even at full barometer. It can only fail if someone hugs you, you play tennis, etc. Whenever your meter is over 50%, you’re going to start involuntarily tooting every once in a while. As soon as you detect it, hit control. But you mustn’t exclusively use control to get through the day! If you fill up the gauge completely and still deny release, air will back up into your stomach, you’ll pass out ill and have to stay home all the next day. That can really hurt your progress. (You won’t have farted, though, so there’s that.) Finesse the keys however you see fit. Follow your gut, so she doesn’t have to.SYSTEM – THE LADIES: Each playthrough is unique because most of the girls’ traits are randomized every game. Learning and paying attention to these traits is key to knowing how to please the girls and especially how to avoid boxer-bombing the ones you have your eyes on. You’ll have to learn some traits as you play. Here are some examples:Gwendolyn is a rich socialite who wants to become an actress.Disposition: Sophisticated, but forgivingFavorite food: ????Keen sense of: (~~sight~~, **hearing**, ~~smell~~, ~~touch~~, ~~taste~~)Poor sense of: ????Idea of a perfect date: A night at the opera.Friends with: ☆Persephone, Abigail, ???? (☆ denotes best friend)Mortal Enemy: ????Initially reluctant?: **No**\---------------------------------------------------------------Sylvia is a goth girl who writes fanfic based on horror manga.Disposition: ???? *(This trait doesn’t ever change but it is sometimes hidden at first. New players will need to learn the ropes.)*Favorite food: Extra-beany MexicanKeen sense of: (~~sight~~, ~~hearing~~, **smell**, ~~touch~~, ~~taste~~)Poor sense of: (**sight**, ~~hearing~~, ~~smell~~, ~~touch~~, ~~taste~~)Idea of a perfect date: Spooning in a hermetically sealed coffin.Friends with: ☆Isabella, Rosemary, ???? (☆ denotes best friend)Mortal Enemy: ????Initially reluctant?: **No**\---------------------------------------------------------------Isabella is the athletic type, currently into swimming, but recently wants to try tennis for some reason.Disposition: B-Baka!!Favorite food: French pastriesKeen sense of: ????Poor sense of: (~~sight~~, ~~hearing~~, ~~smell~~, **touch**, ~~taste~~)Idea of a perfect date: ???? *(This trait is usually an unchanging character specific event, but there is a chance it will be selected from a pool of generic activities like movies or picnics, making that character a little easier to court.)*Friends with: ☆Sylvia, Camilla, ???? (☆ denotes best friend)Mortal Enemy: GwendolynInitially reluctant?: **No**\---------------------------------------------------------------Emma is an artist, hoping to find the most beautiful subjects for her sculptures.Disposition: ????Favorite food: ????Keen sense of: ????Poor sense of: ????Idea of a perfect date: Skiing on nearby Mt. Tuuting *(learned from someone else)*Friends with: ☆????, ????, ????Mortal Enemy: ????Initially reluctant?: **Yes**More about traits in detail: Enjoying foods together is a simple way to let girls know you appreciate them, but so help me, one bite of certain gas-producing categories can result in Lance single-handedly destroying the ozone layer.Understanding the five senses is absolutely critical in forging relationships. Girls with keen **hearing** are able to detect the sounds of softer, briefer relief, and they can more easily tell where it came from. Even then, feel free to let it rip on a roller coaster, for example. Girls with poor hearing may still be able to notice your pucker-whistles if you are sitting in a classical concert listening to a quiet minuet. Girls with keen **smell** are some of the hardest to successfully date. Timing isn’t everything. Entire rooms become contaminated, and you need to find ways to excuse yourself to places you think won’t be a problem later. You may even need to move the date along before she wants to leave. Girls with keen **touch** feel rumbles. Choose standing or walking activites rather than sitting ones if possible. Get into situations where you fart only into open air; butt nothing else. Keep physical contact with her to a minimum. An embrace or even shoulder-leaning can put pressure on your torso that quakes your whole body and hers. Girls with keen **sight** are mostly not a problem, but they will notice when you look uncomfortable from gas. The number one issue is underwater activities. Bubbles WILL be noticed and can deflate your chances faster than you can say Beano. Poor sight is a very nice trait because often she won’t know who to blame for your brass section. Girls with keen **taste** are the absolute best. This one is the freebie in the fart department. They never have high-level detection of your pooting. They respond especially well to good foods, but especially poorly to foods they don’t like.Perfect dates: You don’t have to take girls on dream dates most of the time. Tea at a café or a walk in the park is just dandy unless it directly contradicts their personalities. To go on a special event date, you will need to have a good relationship with her and possibly have met certain plot prerequisites. Stakes are really high on these dates. Control your bowels and you might seal the deal. But one false toot and you could break her image of you for good. Poisoning the air will leave her fuming. Look for ways to tactically integrate bodily functions and distractions. “Wow! You were suddenly like a jet going down the slopes! Even the snow melted behind you!”Other possible perfect dates:* blowing up balloons for a party* doing each other’s laundry* a day at the water park* building a house of cards* TwisterFriends: The friends system is a double-edged sword. One of the surest ways into a young lady’s heart is good rapport with the others she’s close to. On the other hand… that gossip, though… It’s not just your backside blasts that can cause problems. Don’t mistreat or completely brush off your love interest’s friends. There’s a 50% chance they will share it within one degree of separation. This increases to 90% with best friends☆.Mortal Enemies: Everyone is randomly assigned one of these, just like friends. There are multiple ways to use enemies to your advantage including jealousy and sabotaging relationships you don’t want to persue. The disadvantage is that any girl really, really wants you to have nothing to do with her rival. If you disgust her enough, she’ll tell her enemy all about it.SYSTEM – OTHER TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL: Up until this point you really don’t have enough resources to be discreet like you need to be. The Barometer fills up multiple times every day, and there’s just no way to hide it all while spending time with your interests. Let me introduce you to two other great resources. **1)** Every week on Sunday, you visit the doctor and receive two doses of Pew-B-Gone, a medicine that immediately binds with gasses and reduces them to thin collapsing foam. Press F1 to clench-activate where it's stored. The Barometer instantly hits zero. Only twice a week! So use it wisely. **2)** Your bros. Hey, ladies aren’t your only aquaintances! Mark from the tennis team, Ferdinand who loves the science lab, and Keisuke the DJ all want to give you a hand. These guy-friends are your wingmen, but believe me, you are the wind beneath their wings. They may be willing to take the blame for some farts ONLY if they don’t have their eyes on someone in that social network, putting their own reputations in jeopardy. They can also butt in to a conversation and give you a chance for the sweet release of a moment alone. However, they will not help you at all if they are interested in the same girl as you. Relationships can get a little foggy.I’d better wrap this up. Some quick points!You can text girls or guys on your phone with pre-set lines for various purposes, but YOU have to type them out. As the player. Manually, on your keyboard. Pressing **space** and **shift**. Which makes you fart. well,ifyouchoosenottopressthosekeys,that’sokay,too. But don’t be surprised if the response is less agreeable.Get used to the day schedules. Mornings before school are the ideal time to meet someone new without committing much. “It’s great to finally meet you. Well, gotta go!” Every once in a while, an initially reluctant girl might try to meet you here, too. Don’t meet every girl unless you want to experience life on hard mode. Juggling 16 ladies is truly hard, and you’ll end up totally winded. Evenings are for dates, careful dinners, precious time alone if possible. Saturdays are for events, not only perfect dates, but some school and town events. Sunday is totally free, but must include the hospital.Just when you think you are safely alone with someone in a controlled environment with your carefully planned southern atmospherics, lo and behold, unexpected admirers may “accidentally” show up and be a part of your day, so try to be ready for anything.And then there’s the game's menus with gifts, phone numbers, etc. but the length of this game idea is getting out of hand. Really, it’s time to nip this in the bum.SYSTEM – END GAME So, a win condition is not exactly set in stone. On Saturday of the first week you had to write a girl’s name in your journal whom you think you’d like to persue romantically. Of course, you aren’t bound to her, you won’t lose if she gets away, but you’ll earn a higher rating if you can match it by the 30 day mark. At the end of the second week and then the third week write the names of girls you hope to have good friendships with. The more you can correctly predict, the better. You get a slight boost the more challenging their traits are. Also, overall popularity adds greatly to your rating, as does your ending physical health. Other minor benefits include whether your bro friends can end up with their crushes and how many doses of Pew-B-Gone you have left over (unused is better!). If you don’t end up with a girlfriend at all, no matter what else, your rating won’t be higher than a D.RatingsSSS  .......(Super Success Syndrome!)SS    .......(Smooth and Silent, Not Deadly!)S      .......(Satisfaction Quaranteed!)A      .......(Airtight Results)B     .......(Butt Not Too Bad)C     .......(Cough! Could be worse!)D     .......(Disappointment in the Air)F      .......(Flatlining from Flatulence)Frrt .......(Ok, Would Someone *Please* Open a Window?!)Oh, also! Given the genre and the dedication of players, one personal “meta” win condition is to always try to aim for the same girl each playthrough, no matter what her traits, guiding your *bottom line* only for her sake because she is your ~~Waipu~~, I’m sorry, Waifu. In other words, what’s the highest rating you can get *per character?*So that’s it. This is my completely serious attempt at the dating sim genre. I hope it’s not too obvious that I have never played a game like this before. I hope the main gimmick isn’t too ~~vapor~~ vapid. But I eagerly await constructive criticism. I’ve heard that recent games have been pretty out there, like dating pigeons and swords and other nonsense. Isn’t it time we had a truly normal sim? It would be such a gas!&#x200B;I definitely have way too much free time at work.&#x200B;Edit: [what am I doing with my life???](https://imgur.com/a/FGXFZd4)
 
Time Traveling Detective Game 
You are part of the Synchronatic Defense Agency and its your job to preserve history and to ensure what should happen does happen. There are various criminals, some accidental and some purposeful, who travel the time stream and change things, screwing up history to disastrous results if not stopped. You have to go to different periods of history and piece together who the culprit is and how thy will or have screwed up history using clues in a kind of "LA Noire" style of piecing things together. You also have to determine how to deal with them. You have different options and tech at your disposal but, of course, if you use it on the wrong person or if it turns out the culprit, themselves, is somehow important to the time stream then you can do more harm than good with your actions. Other than the basic approach to the detective work, I'm not sure what else would be involved. It certainly is a larger overall project than I will be tackling anytime in the near future (pun intended) ;)I'd love to hear some thoughts on this.
 
A horror game where you aren't the victims 
The idea I had was a game where a monster of some kind is hunting and killing the main characters except it doesn't care about you as the player. For example imagine a sci-fi horror about an alien hunting the crew of a spaceship except instead of being a crew member you are a generic matinence robot and have to work to save them.
 
Magical girl styled RPG? 
While games like Hyperdimension Neptunia exist, i’d love to see something themed after magical girls that is less fan service-y or sexual, thats focused more on lore, or styling your heroes with magic powers or abilities themed to fit your playstyle.Something RPG styled like the Tales series or Final Fantasy series, or abandon a turn based style and come up with something with more free combat like Bayonetta, a perfect example of magical girl (albeit demonic) style gameplay, though not rpg, and a bit too sexual.I realize it isnt a full idea, but im saying that, if it was available, i’d love to play something more female focused, or even mix a team of guys and girls with more magical girl series themes like transformations or magical weapons or objects, special moves designed for a final attack (Sailor Moon for example, using her Tiara or whatever weapon she uses at the time). Most games styled like this seem to be kind of on the cheaper side, not too much of a variety in area or a very generic look, and i can understand, given that the genre isnt a popular one, but i hope eventually something magical girl themed becomes popular.
 
A multiplayer haunted house game in which AI demons will kill you and possess your body to kill the rest of your team. You can can avoid getting killed by demons by staying quiet on the mic and moving carefully, but then your teammates might kill you thinking you had been possessed. 
You walk a fine line between not getting killed by the AI demons and not scaring your teammates into thinking you were killed and are now being controlled by the AI. If you cry out for help over voice chat or voice commands, you might get killed by the AI, but if you stay too quiet while you approach your teammates for group safety, they might kill you with their melee weapons instead.****The premise is stupid simple: Self-proclaimed demon hunters from across Instagram group up to YOLO some abandoned hospital/mansion/gravesite/ect. (depending what map got chosen)... all to take selfies at randomized locations there "for the gram." Unbeknownst to them, demons are real. Real *vicious.* Now the influencers must split up to take their selfies at their designated locations as fast as possible before a portal to hell opens up ^(or someshit —I don't know, I haven't thought this far ahead. It's absurd though.)
 
murder=brains. a game where you do demonic blood sacrifice to increase your IQ 
this game is about a boy who is having trouble getting good grades, so he decides to make a deal with a demon, in exchange for the brutal bloody murder of other students he will increase your IQ for the test.in this game your goal is to murder enough students to pass all the tests, the bloodier and messier the murder the more the demon is fed but also the harder it will be to clean up, the kill that satisfies the demon the most is actually kidnapping the student and having the demon eat them at the summoning circle. satisfying the demon gives you two things: 1:a small permanent boost to your IQ 2:a large temporary boost to your IQ. so while a sacrifice is always nice its the most effective right before a test.as you go through the school year the tests get progressively harder and many of the lower grade students leave, to it gets trickier as there is more need for extra IQ and less targets to sacrifice.thats basically the game, i know the perspective and gameplay aren't quite clear but this is the main concept.
 
(OPINION) Game ideas that depend on licensed IP 
I see lots of half baked ideas on here, which is fine. The ones that really bug me are games that depend on licensed brands.Simply throwing the marvel brand at a preexisting game genre doesn't make the idea unique or interesting. I'm sure if you have a preexisting Fandom with the IP the idea might be exciting to you but that doesn't mean it automatically will make a decent game.Good games are fun by the core of the mechanics. If the game isn't fun it doesn't matter if spider man is in it or not.Not only that but the idea is potentially pointless because if there are developers looking for game ideas in this subreddit they 99.9% of the time won't have the funds to purchase the licensing. If a game developer is in here looking for ideas they're likely looking for fun new interesting mechanics that haven't been tried or thought of. Somethings that's fun, unique and sticks out from the rest. If you have a idea on how to milk money out of players with microtransactions then I'm sure it might be used in the next marvel/star wars game.
 
Roguelike where you continue playing as the enemy, that defeated you. 
You start in the middle of the dungeon. You possess a hero and you want to go deeper down, where enemies get thougher.When you die, you switch roles and want to progress upwards and escape the dungeon. But the heroes become stronger closer to the surface.So there are two possible Endings for you._Not perfect but maybe somebody can expand on it.._
 
A Battle Royale about Getting a Job 
It’s called today’s job market. /sYou, along with one hundred others, are all “applicants” to a highly competitive career and need to prove yourself to win. Players duke it out by performing activities around an office building that contribute to your success near the end. You can fire staples at other players, delay them with talk about their interest in the field, and try to devalue the actions they’re done by doing things that cancel them out (i.e they got a resume from the computer room? You destroy it before it gets to the boss’ office.After time runs out, the ten players with the most items enter the “interview”, a small mosh pit room with “the boss” monster in the centre smacking away players if they get too close.
 
An SCP facility management game 
There are SCP games out there but they're almost always first person horror games taking place during a breach. I think it would be really cool to have a top down game where you are in control of a facility and its your responsibility to capture, contain, and recapture SCPs.   A gameplay loop example would be having SCPs show up and you have a certain amount of time to scout it for info, prepare a capture operation, prepare temporary and permanent quarters, and then maybe you have a little buffer time to create more permanent procedures.   This becomes a base building game to where you need to consider different materials for the rooms, set up a steady stream of sacrificial D class personal, maybe use a support SCP to help contain a more dangerous one, etc. It also becomes a capture game (I'm thinking like a mini RTS battle with prep).   If you wanted to make this idea super big and unrealistic, maybe make it like an MMO where there's different difficulty SCPs and everyone gets assigned a random easy few at the beginning (as there's many SCPs) and you have the option to go for more difficult ones, which need a lot of prep and containment. Acquiring more dangerous SCPs could possibly give more revenue and technology as a later level reward.Edit: Lobotomy Corporation used an SCP to steal my idea, travel back in time, and make the game before I thought of it
 
An arcade shoot'em up in which the goal is to upgrade your ship so much that it plays itself. 
This is like a hybrid between an arcade shmup (think R-Type) and clicker games. You gain XP by destroying enemies, and then you can spend those points on upgrading your ship to gain XP faster.As your ship gets larger with every add-on upgrade, it becomes harder to evade, so the gameplay slowly shifts from actively evading enemy fire to passively *tanking* enemy fire with your growing ship. Eventually your ship becomes as large as the screen-filling bosses you fight against.And when you thought you're near the end and your ship can't get any larger, the camera zooms out for *Stage Two*, and your ship is once again small relative to the screen.
 
Asymmetrical multiplayer game (I know these get a lot of shit). One person plays from a RTS type view (Spawn Minions, build a base). The other team plays as a fps and their goal is to destroy the RTS players base. 
I know asymmetrical games get a lot of shit (Evolve I'm looking at you) but I do think that's because one hasn't been done right (Hopefully Doom Eternal's BattleMode fixes that). If there is a game like this already please let me know. Especially if it has a offline mode (My internet is really shitty, 100 kb/s most of the time so online is out of the question).Thank you anyone browsing by new and who looks at this.
 
A battle Royale, but it's in a neighbourhood/town and the characters you play are neighbours 
I'm kinda craving for a new battle royale game that isn't just a mundane shooter. I want mayhem and craziness. Something unique.This game would comprise a selection of characters with different abilities. Every character will be able to interact with different things around the map and have an ability to summon an object, weapon or vehicle, e.g. Grandma with the ability to summon a modified mobility scooter that drives fast, or the dad with the ability to summon a large lawn mower to mow down the competition. All of these characters would have abilities that will give them an advantage in some way. Somebody could lock house doors to delay opponents from getting in whilst you prepare. Another could climb walls (the parkour guy)These characters could include:Mum/ DadSon/ DaughterGrandma/ GrandadPolice OfficerAnd others like workers, a parkour guy FBI guy etc.Some objects can be picked up and used as weapons, like a baseball bat from the shed or a knife from the kitchen drawers. Machined weapons will obviously be scattered about the map for the players to use.Different parts of the map could have shops that you could walk into and purchase items like weapons, aid or vehicles, with the Mall giving you the best variety of items to choose from.I also considered a different way of starting the game, rather than jumping from the sky out of a plane (like almost every other battle royale) players could choose a location and pop out of a manhole cover from the ground at that location.The game could be expandable by adding new characters you can earn through gameplay, new maps and new weapons/abilities.Anyone else have any suggestions.Man I wish I could develop games
 
Game idea where you can go back in time and stop tragic events of the past from happening 
I don’t know much about code or game development, but this idea came to my head around 4:00 am last night and I spent a while thinking about it. Basically the concept is you are from the year 2205, and you chose a magic element (i.e fire, earth, lightning) to start with. Then, you are given the ability to choose an event from the past to time travel to, such as the holocaust, 9/11, or Lincoln’s assasination(those were some I thought of). At first the NPC’s don’t believe you are from the future and think you’re lying, and you have to find certain ways to convince them you are from the future and tell them what’s going to happen and you have to perform quest chains to prevent the event from happening(i.e. stopping the people from hijacking the plane that would run into the twin towers) using the magic element you chose. After you complete the quest chain to stop the event, you earn reputation, in which you can use to upgrade your magic powers to do harder quest chains/events with multiple quest chains. I’ve always been a fan of rpg/story mode games, and I would love to see this game come to life despite me having no development skills whatsoever.
 
a game inside a game inside a game inside a game inside a... 
so basically, your character has managed to get themself embedded ass deep in a meta rabbithole, stuck in a game within a game within a game within a game within a game with a etc. every game world is a different genre of game, and eacyh one beaten gets you closer to the real world. maybe at the end of the game the character realises theyre still in a game, and that they were never in the real world in the first place
 
Imagine being able to fully customize your hairstyle in games. 
You highlight spaces on your head where you want hair to appear, even sections of the hair for how the hair will be styled. You get to use a scale for how long the hair is, for how stiff/silky the hair is, and how the hair is done (natural, dreadlocks, ponytails, curls, etc.).Most games just have you pick hairstyles and that's it. Want a mohawk with ponytails... somehow? Nope, just get what they give you
 
Game like Phasmophobia but with aliens 
So hear me out. I think it's a great idea to have such a game considering the success of Phasmophobia. Your tasks in this game would bo to investigate possible UFO sightings (like corn fields or country farms idk) and possibly even see the space dudes themselves. There also should be a various amount of different alien species like your typical green lil dudes or the greys or even insectoids. Hell, maybe even some reptilians to spice things up. I also think it should knda resemble the movie Signs (the one with Joaquin Phoenix and Mel Gibson). I mean like the whole atmosphere of a secluded location like a country house where it's only you and couple of friends with you and the feel that you're not alone and you're being watched. You can even have abductions in this game and your goal will be to gain as much evidence as possible and make it out alive. What do you think about this? I've been thinking on this idea for a good while since I first tried playing Phasmophobia and enjoyed it.  Damn, I'm actually surprised to see that there are so few decent horror games that involve aliens and/or abduction by them because this theme seems very popular in the culture of like almost every country. People love unexplainable stuff, like Bigfoot, Chupacabra etc.
 
A game where potions aren't just stat boosters. 
Alchemy in games bore me because either there are better alternatives or the brewing system is plain bad. I want a game where your character is just the weakest soul imaginable and needs to utilize potion brewing to overcome huge odds.  I don't really care if it's a huge AAAA open world or a 2d platformer. I want to play a game where a speed potion isn't just increasing your speed by 20% but also changes the drinker's legs into, for example, rabbit legs that increases your speed, jump height and allows you to do special kick attacks.  Another example I thought of is a metal potion. If you drink it, you're temporarily resistant to slashing damage but move slower. If you pour the potion over your arms, you turn them into blades which you can use to attack and block. You can also throw the potion on another enemy. The effect is the same but you can use that to get out of bad situations thanks to the added slowness.  Whoever makes the game can be really creative with designing potion varieties.
 
Gambling RPG 
Every year a certain individual is brought towards the underground gambling arena. These people are all in debt and need money asap to pay it off and go back to society. They are brought by force and forced to gamble against each other on high stakes. The people who make these arenas profit from rich men who come and watch.
 
A battle royale food fight where players throw food at one another to win 
This will take place in a pretty big school where the players can explore and find foods to use and defeat other players. The school would either have to be really big or just have fewer players in it per game. Different foods will have different projectiles. For instance a bag of chips would have projectiles like shurikens or burgers would have a slower but harder hitting projectile. Students can also had different attributes to their foods like hot sauce/spicy to make their projectiles have a burning effect. Instead of a circle that gets smaller it would be teachers and faculty (cpu) who will catch students and give them detention(tbd). I liked how warzone gave players a second chance of life with the gulag so in food fight students can do a mini game to slip out of detention to try again (tbd). If the player is eliminated again they will be expelled. Let me know what you think. It’s my first time really voicing any of my ideas.
 
There should be a Mount & Blade: Warhammer 
For those of you that know the Warhammer Universe and have played the Mount & Blade games (progression, army building, sieges, battles). Imagine if developers created a Mount & Blade fantasy game in the Warhammer universe. Playing as an Orc to plunder, ravage and spread WAAGH! Throughout the old World, or as a Human/Elf/Dwarf each with their own power struggles and Inter faction politics. The campaign would be a lot more epic as well. The Mount & Blade campaign seems underwhelming to me, no story beyond the power struggles in the kingdoms. Bring in the Warhammer universe and the posibilites are endless. The gear system would be a lot more varied as well. With each faction specializing in their own weapons.
 
Just an idea i had 
I been seeing a lot of space exploration games and destroying the environment kinda games lately. what if we had a game that did the opposite. I was thinking you start on a empty planet or space as a first person adventurer. you have the ability to to create your own ecosystem, plants and animals, kinda the same way you do in Spore, and there is no limit on how much you can create. but first you have to mine craft and create a livable place. And also it would be cool if evolution took place and you can defend yourself against predators of your own creations.
 
Papers, Please VR 
OVERVIEW:- The main gameTaking the original [Papers, Please](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please) and turning it into a VR game. For those who don’t know about it, Papers, Please is a game created Lucas Pope, a fellow indie dev, about being a border inspector for a communist country. The main game mechanics involve processing people wishing to come into the country for “X” amount of reasons, some for work, visit, immigration, or to cause an uprising and bring the current government down. The player must approve or deny entry to all who come to the checkpoint based on what is written on their passports and/or the rules that are given and that are added or changed each day within the allotted amount of time. Each properly processed individual earns the player money while individuals processed with discrepancies or those denied with nothing blatantly wrong will result in a penalty. The game has multiple endings based on what the player does and who they allow or deny entry, even requiring to tranquilize extremists if the situation calls for it. Read more on the Wikipedia article- The VR PortLike it’s original, the VR version would have the same base mechanics of processing individuals. However, instead of a 2D view of everything, the entire checkpoint booth would be in 3D and 360° viewable with windows showing the line of people and the other side. Using their motion controllers, the player would have to physically grab the documents to read them, point to a discrepancy, call for the next individual, operate the stamps and even snipe extremists from where they stand/sit. FEATURES:- Low resolution, because of the game’s use of pixels, game models and other things don’t have to be complex, expensive RAM-wise or detailed. Even the people’s portraits don’t have to be modeled but instead be cardboard cutouts.- Immersive 3D Space, allows the player to take advantage of their environment or make it so not everything is in front of the player, requiring them to turn and look around. - (OPTIONAL) Exclusive Campaign, including the original game’s campaign, the VR port could have its own story, utilizing the VR capabilities. NOTE:I would like to see this made in VR, even if it’s just a clone. Also, while VR is limited currently in what it can do, instead of trying to make a game as if said limitations aren’t there game devs should try and make those limitations their strength and utilize them uniquely in order to get people to enjoy it.
 
Successfully incorporating multiple endings in a game where there is a big reveal in the game world? 
Exactly as the title suggests, working on the story for my game and I want to have multiple endings. The problem is that, in the story as I have it now, there is quite a large twist to the world. I have a feeling that if I have the "big reveal" in multiple endings then having the player do some actions later on that influences the end, it won't have the same impact on repeat playthroughs. So my thoughts currently on how I could make this work out is as follows:\- Have only 1 ending where there is the "big reveal" (Downside is that you can't branch any endings off of that "big reveal")\- Have multiple endings where there is the "big reveal" (Downside is that the convo talking about said reveal will be repetitive and less impactful on each playthrough)\- Have only 1 ending (Downsides: Wanting to create a game with player interaction and choices, having only 1 ending would make that feature pretty much gone)\- Have other twists in the other endings (Downsides: Hard to think of many that would match the impact of the big one)Im sure there are better solutions but I'm not the best at creating stories, any help is appreciated! Questions are welcome
 
A game where you don't customize yourself, 
A game where instead of customizing yourself you customize your enemy it would be a one-v-one game set in a unique Arena you could give your opponents weapons that lowered their base damage or armors that lowered their base defense. you could spend points to lower their stats or even remove some of their abilities. you would attempt to defeat your opponent and then you to move on to more opponents where you got to remove less and less of their stuff
 
A VR game in which you are a tiny alien piloting a human from inside his head, going about your days trying not to get found out that you aren't human. 
The cockpit is like the panoramic ones in Titanfall, and you control your "human" with a bunch of retro-style levers, pulleys and switches. The premise is like Octodad in that you are pretending to be human while doing various odd jobs, except you also have to have natural-ish conversations using your limited speech module.The story and ultimate goal is that you came to Earth in search of your loved one who became stranded here years ago. You were able to pinpoint their location to this corporate office building, so you infiltrated by pretending to work here as "the new guy" and now everyone is giving you random tasks thinking you work in their department.You are certain one of these humans is your beloved alien partner (much more experienced at acting human). You can't drop your ruse yourself, so you have to eliminate suspects one by one while you work among them to hopefully find your love and finally escape Earth together.The humor is very [Strange Planet](https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/) in the way your alien sees humans and in the way he speaks with his speech module.
 
A video game that alternates snake and pac-man levels where your snake path determines the maze for pac-man in the next level and where the locations where pac-man eats ghosts determine the locations of food for the next snake level. • r/Lightbulb 
 
A game where only you can see the monsters and the townsfolk will stop helping you if you aren’t careful. 
I’m thinking the game would be pretty 2D, probably with pixel art instead of anything detailed. The town is small, maybe only a handful of residential houses and then you have your general blacksmith/potion maker etc.There are monsters coming from most places around town; from mountains and maybe a forest and caves and stuff. If there’s a story element, your character’s goal would be to stop all the monsters and save the town forever. Maybe an endless mode too.If the townsfolk see you fighting the monsters (to them you’re just swinging a sword/shooting arrows at thin air) then they’ll become distrustful of you, getting nervous, raising prices or perhaps not selling things to you. If they become too distrustful, they’ll drive you out of town and it’ll be game over.I hope you like the idea :)
 
A visual novel that gradually gets more disturbing depending on how late at night/early in the morning you play it. 
This would have to be based on your time zones (sort of like Mystic Messenger I believe). Basically, it's a visual novel/horror game that would sort of break the fourth wall, much like *Doki Doki Literature Club.* The setting of the game is an average Japanese high school with adorable anime girls that you can bond with. At the end of the day, the girl you interacted most with that day will give you real-life advice, normally something simple, like "Remember to stay hydrated!" or "If you're having trouble finding friends, just put yourself out there!" After giving this advice, you can explore the school, go to clubs, or go straight home to work on homework for five minutes real-time until the sleeping cutscene (six seconds real-time).However, the first time you play through a day at school, the girl you interacted with will tell you: "You best not stay up too late. You don't want to know what happens when you stay up too late." The times for "normal" gameplay would be 7:30 A.M to around 11:30 P.M. The game is still playable for the half hour between 11:30 and midnight, but slightly more unsettling, with the days taking longer and the girls taking on slightly glitched appearances, with sometimes distorted text, and advice also being distorted (instead of "Remember to stay hydrated," it would be "Remember to d̶͈͝š̵̡f̷̘͛ģ̶̓t̶͎̃ǹ̴͉ỳ̵̧s̸̩̅b̵͙̚f̶̗̃ḁ̸͒y̷̰͝ū̷̩d̴͔̋h̸̠͂f̴͉̓v̸̟̈ĝ̴̘ý̷̫ẃ̶̙f̴͇͗u̵̟͒s̷̟̈ȗ̴̬e̴̬̕k̴̰̾h̴͚̄ŕ̶̡g̶͉̋") At midnight, it goes to full-on horror game, and even if you're at home or in the sleep cutscene, the MC will be sent to the lobby of the school. Text will flash on the screen that says "I told you not to stay up late." Your goal is now to survive the school (filled with students taking on forms of indescribable horror, the main girls being the fastest and most powerful) until normal gameplay hours resume, or you can simply choose to save your progress, close out the game and go to bed.If you choose to continue with a save file made during horror hours, then where you pick up depends on when you resume playing. If you continue with that save file during normal hours, then you will be back in normal hours. However, the reverse happens if you play during horror hours on a save file made during normal hours.Thoughts?
 
A survival game where you are being constantly followed by some kind of slow moving being (like It Follows) while trapped on a large island. 
I’m not surprised if something exactly like this has already been done, but I just like the concept of desperately trying to survive in a harsh unforgiving environment, while having to be constantly vigilant of this creature that would be always walking towards you slowly but never stopping. You’d also have to not stay in one place for too long, I don’t know how sleeping would work maybe every time you sleep the monsters is suddenly way closer. I guess I’m just a sucker for the intense feeling you get while knowing your being hunted in a game.
 
A game design I put together as part of a recent interview 
I wanted to share this design exercise i did while applying for new positions recently. Thought it might be helpful to read. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-design-exercise-andrew-chambers
 
Roguelike with a single main mechanic: a torch. Use it to attack enemies or to prevent them from attacking you. Turn-based game, but the fire of the torch slowly goes out in real-time 
* Very minimalistic game in which you carry a single element: a torch.* You can use the torch you're holding in the following ways:   * as protection: while holding it and it is lit, enemies can't attack you   * to see your way through the dark dungeon   * to melee attack enemies (the fire goes out faster)   * to throw at an enemy setting it and other close enemies (if any) on fire in a kind of chain reaction. But after you throw the torch you are vulnerable to attacks.* There are torches on the walls of the dungeon as well that you can pick when you're next to them. The fire of these never go out while hanging from the wall.* Even though the game is turn-based, the fire of the torch you're holding goes out in real-time, putting some pressure on you to think fast.
 
Realistic 1 bullet kills war game w/ body hopping 
Remember the original version of the Rainbow Six videogame?   One bullet was enough to kill or permanently maim, even with body armor.   Take that realism, use it in a war shooter game, and then add a unique respawn system, where  the camera leaves your dead body, and zooms into another soldier's body somewhere else in the operation.  Then balance the difficulty until the average player dies as much as the casualty rate in that event.  Imagine how dangerous it would feel to storm the beaches of Normandy, w/out Call of Duty's bs regen mechanic? Or other famous battles.  Especially if the game spent some effort to humanize the soldiers you play as with voice lines, and realistic portrayals.
 
A Stealth game where you have a bunch of very powerful gadgets, but if you get caught using them the enemy will start deploying countermeasures. 
[](/adventureflutters)Some examples of the concept:* You have a temporary cloaking device to avoid being seen, but if you bump into an enemy guard or if they see you fade in / out then guards with thermal vision will start showing up.* You have a grappling hook, but if you're seen with it then a lot of high up places you'd normally use it for will be boarded up.* You have an electric mine that knocks out enemies that step on it. If a second enemy witnesses it then they'll deploy countermeasures like insulated shoes or detection drones.* A hacking device to get through locked doors with a password. Once found out security will switch and you'll have to start getting keycards off enemies to get through them instead, or maybe it will take much longer to hack more secure passwords.* You could also have things like EMP grenades or knockout gas that the enemy will know about as soon as you use it and will slowly start ramping up defenses against the more you use them instead of instantly deploying the answer.So this will come with a couple of big design challenges.First, you want to make sure that a tool is *less* useful, not just outright disabled after the enemy starts playing around it.Second, there needs to be some incentive to keep playing once you get found out instead of just restarting to keep your favorite toy, or maybe you're in situations where you need to use a tool to get away and reveal it that way. Maybe the ending changes depending on how many restarts you do, or maybe it auto-saves when you're discovered. In either case, maybe the answer is that it should be a shorter game with an emphasis on replayability and game mastery.
 
My first concept 
Hey, r/gameideas! i'm a freashman in gamedev, and i need your help. I just finished my first concept, I want your opinion on it.[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u5QY63EDEnqDD5XGuXiWtPg46QvKln53E3n4JD9PYMU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u5QY63EDEnqDD5XGuXiWtPg46QvKln53E3n4JD9PYMU/edit?usp=sharing)
 
A deceptive dungeon crawler that acts as an analogy for addiction and escapism 
This is an idea I've had for a while, "Deep Down". Its kinda a lot to explain, so I'll walk you through the game from start to finish.**The Game**The game starts off with you, the nameless protagonist, chopping wood in a forest at night. You are approached by a demoness. She bluntly states that she's a devil from the underworld, but the game holds a lighthearted tone. Like her being a demon is nothing more than a stylistic choice. She tells you about a fantastical dungeon that holds amazing treasures at the bottom, and offers to guide you on an adventure to the bottom of the dungeon. She leaves, and the cutscene ends. From here, there is only one button you can press. A button to go to the dungeon and begin the actual game. The player can take no other action and will continue to watch their character chop wood until they press the button. This might all sound trivial, but it’ll come back later.Then the game actually starts. It’s a pretty traditional top down hack and slash. The demon acts as a Navi type character who explains how to play, exposits lore, describes monsters, and is generally the only real character in the game, since the protagonist is silent. The dungeon is split into floors, with each floor being a level. Everytime you beat a floor, you jump down a trapdoor and enter the next level, without being able to go back up to previous floors. Everytime you descend, the Demon heals you to full health(there's no natural health regen). She always hangs out at the beginning of the floor. Anytime you die, she brings you back to life, functioning as a standard respawn system with infinite lives. As you play, you’ll get more equipment, unlock upgrades, standard adventure/RPG mechanics.Okay, at this point, the game starts showing its true colors. The player starts finding notes from previous adventurers. Up until now, the game has been very colorful and whimsical, but these notes are a bit more grim. They subtly warn the player about a few things. That the demon should not be trusted, and that reaching the bottom of the dungeon is not the true goal. As the player gets deeper, the game gradually changes. The demon begins acting more suspiciously, the monsters become more fantastical and whimsical, and the note’s warnings become more obvious. They also begin giving hints on an in-game mechanic that allows the player to climb back up to previous floors. Something along the line of equipping specific armors, activating items in a certain order, etc. Something specific enough that it would take a bit of time to figure out.Once the player figures out the trick and attempts to climb back up, the demon drops her act. She states that she has been luring you down, and that climbing back up is near impossible. As soon as you enter the previous floor, the game changes drastically. The aesthetic changes from being colorful and whimsical to dreary and dark, replacing the fantastical creatures with uncanny mutants. But more importantly, the demon is no longer following you. Up until this point, she's been effectively the only character, making the game extremely lonely without her. You can continue to climb backwards through the levels, going from the exit point to the entrance, with the levels being altered with new enemies/traps/items. However, the game is MUCH more difficult now. Without the demon, you no longer heal at the end of every level, and when you die, you don’t respawn at the beginning of the level. You respawn where SHE’S waiting, at the lowest floor you’ve been to. From here, the goal of the game becomes clear, return to the first floor and exit the dungeon, but the deeper you went into the dungeon, the harder it is to escape. Once you finally escape, there’s no fanfare or epic treasure. Your character takes his axe, and continues chopping wood. From here, the game returns to exactly how it started. Your character chops wood and you only one have one button, “return to the dungeon”.But what if the player continues going down the dungeon? They will eventually hit a point where the game just blatantly tells them to turn around and how to do it, but they can choose to ignore it. The demon starts being more honest, explaining that you’ll never be able to leave. At the last few floors the game becomes trivially easy. Once you hit the long awaited bottom floor, there's no treasure. It’s just a dark room with some skeletons in it. Once you hit this floor, the player can take no actions, all they can do is sit there and listen to the demon talk to herself/the protagonist indefinitely. The game effectively soft locks, forcing the player to delete their save data to start over.**Thoughts**The protagonist is a blank canvas character, just a stand in for the player. But the demon and her dungeon can represent a lot of different things. Drug usage, compulsive gaming, porn addiction, depression, etc. The game’s main structure mimics the downward spiral and delusion caused by addiction. There’s an initial red flag that the whole situation is evil, but just about every player will ignore it. Everything looks wonderful from the inside, but the warnings from prior victims betray it. Only by trying to escape can you see it’s true nature and its grasp on you. And escape doesn’t grant you a wonderful reward, it leaves you right back where you started, with the constant opportunity to relapse.The game also acts as satire, with the dungeon representing the game itself. It criticizes fantasy adventures as being a tool for escapism that disconnects people from reality, while being a fantasy adventure itself. It warns against obsessive waifuism, while desperately trying to get players to like the game’s own demoness, and the only way to win the game is to stop playing it. It has the same sort of spirit as games like Undertale or Oneshot, where they criticize the player for even playing it.The main twist was something I came up with after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwV_mA2cv_0) (as a side note, great watch. Totally recommend Game Maker’s Toolkit). He talks about a dilemma that mystery games have: how do you prompt a player for a solution without inadvertently giving them the answer? So I thought to myself, what if the game didn’t TELL you it was a mystery game? The player doesn’t just have to find the answer, they need to find the QUESTION. The game rewards observant and clever players, since the trek back is easier if you put the pieces together faster. Additionally, learning to not trust the demon can give you advantages, as she sometimes tries to trick the player (“Oh, don’t worry about hoarding potions, you’ll always have me to heal you!”)
 
World War II Simulator 
Hi folks, I'm glad this sub exists. I've always wanted to share this idea somewhere and hope someone out there eventually produces something like it. I'm terrible at explaining things so please bear with me. I'm interested to hear from experienced designers what could be added or removed from the idea.My idea is a first-person World War II simulator. I know what you're thinking, but it's not just a WWII shooter. I noticed that there are hundreds of WWII games out there, but nothing that truly gives you a detailed and immersive experience of being in the war. Combat was only a part of it, and that's typically all an FPS covers. (Background info, I have spent years interviewing dozens of WWII veterans, reading their books, studying primary source material, etc. This is a topic I'm well versed on.)So you start a new game. The game launches with only one battle to start, let's say the Sicily Campaign in 1943. You pick the parameters or go in randomly. You pick the U.S. and go through a tutorial that consist of an authentic basic training environment. You then get assigned to a random unit as a rifleman, say Company C, 180th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division. (For your first playthrough, maybe you can only choose to be a rifleman at the rank of private, more on that later)You and your unit (single player emphasis, all comrades are NPCs) are spawned at the 45th Infantry Division's landing beach near Scoglitti on July 10th, 1943. Now a full 1:1 scale map of Sicily is unreasonable, so I'm thinking the map would be a scaled down version, roughly the in-game size of GTA V's map or a bit smaller.You then endure the campaign as a rifleman would have, but with immersive mechanics and features a la RDR2. You are constantly moving or holding a defensive line. Tedious things to maintain stamina and combat effectiveness and so forth. Examples: eating K-rations, C-rations, foraging and cooking. Finding and treating water, filling your canteen. Looting souvenirs from corpses and German and Italian POWs. Trading for lugers, flags, collectible insignia, etc. Writing letters and receiving mail. Cleaning and maintaining your weapons. Keeping your boots dubbed and treating your feet. Changing socks. Repairing and washing clothing. Digging foxholes as your unit digs in for the night. Maintaining an authentic inventory accurate for a typical rifleman. Treating wounds and going to the aid station for treatment. This list can be expanded.Those tasks are sprinkled throughout combat tasks such as moving out on foot while watching for ambushes, riding vehicles to the line, watching the line from defensive positions, enduring artillery and mortar barrages and strafing from planes, etc. as you move from one important town or hill to another. These towns, hills, etc. can sometimes provide intense combat scenarios. These combat scenarios can be winnable or unwinnable, against an enemy that varies from a couple of snipers to a fully fortified defensive line. You might get ordered out on patrols that turn out to be either fruitless or get you killed. Day/night cycle and weather elements affect everything from combat to the rate at which your trenchfoot develops.Another element to this is that your individual experience is directly connected to an AI-run tactical metagame. You are among your NPC comrades in one company of one regiment of one division, among other divisions, all coordinating together. So the next objective your company is assigned has a real effect on the overall situation depending on whether or not you succeed in taking it, which depends upon how the enemy AI chose to defend it. Your unit strength will deteriorate with casualties, so if you end up with 20 men left in your company in a farmhouse surrounded by a regiment of Germans, you are forced to choose between surrendering or fighting it out. If you surrender, there is a chance you can escape captivity before you're loaded on an enemy transport ship. If your regiment is encircled, you lose access to mail and resupply. There is a chance you'll maybe starve or freeze to death in some campaigns. The single player campaign is over when your side has either won or lost the campaign, or you have been severely wounded, killed, or captured by the enemy.The only NPCs that need to actually be rendered are the ones you interact with, the 200 or so in your company or 40 or so in your platoon, and the enemies and civilians you encounter. Some dialogue options would be nice, such as being able to tell your superiors about the MG position you located, or flirting with the local Italian girls to get some wine, talking to your squad mates about where they're from, interacting and tagging recently taken POWs, etc.As you play the game, you unlock new roles and ranks for the next playthrough. Maybe the second playthrough allows you to play as an NCO such as a sergeant and squad leader, or a medic, or a tank gunner, or a halftrack driver, or a mortarman, whatever is possible. The more you play, the more ranks and roles you unlock, so perhaps by your 5th playthrough you can be a captain in charge of an entire company and issue orders to whole platoons of NPCs. Cap it out at the rank of general commanding the entire 45th division in a tent far from the line and with fewer tedious things to do but with more control of the metagame. In summary, my idea is an open-ended single player WWII FPS with RPG and strategy elements intended to encompass the entirety of an individual's experience. In my fantasy, DLCs are released in chronological order to cover other big battles of the war, each with unique elements to deal with, such as the snow and cold of the Battle of the Bulge, malaria and harsh weather in Guadalcanal, etc. Such a game would be incredibly immersive and educational, with nearly  infinite replay value. You might spawn on the beach on July 10th and take a direct hit from a mortar. You might go days without seeing any enemies. It's all a part of the realistic experience. The key is that you're constantly on edge waiting for the next barrage, counterattack, or ambush.Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on how realistic it would be to create this kind of game and what could be done  to make it better.
 
idk why we don't have an open world rpg that effectively teaches kids how to read by now 
I'm firm on the belief that video games are the future of education. You could fit 10x the amount resources into a video game no problem. At home learning wouldn't be an issue and neither would funding. These kids will do just about anything for in game assets. They'll figure out how to spell any word you give them if you hold character skins over their head. If we can give them that ability they'll be learning faster than you can say no. I can't imagine if this would've existed when I was a child. I understand that we lacked the technology then but we surely don't now. I feel that kids that don't know how to read would find it very beneficial to continue playing and learning about the things that they want to learn about. It'd be unimaginable to watch kids learning core curriculum at their own will.I'm not set on a specific way on how the game should run but it boils down to having everything labeled with words and giving the child the ability to spell these words for in game currency and better opportunities. When a character walks up to a cat they can pet the cat, feed the cat, and above the cat it says "cat". They can click on the word above/below/next to the cat and the game says "cat, c, a, t, cat". In another area they will be challenged to spell the word and be given in game currency if they succeed. The player should also be accompanied with a entity like Navi from the legend of Zelda that helps them to an extent with guiding them to accomplish each and every task the player is given.  The Navi would be the one spelling out each and every word the player clicks on. The world would be filled with multiple worlds. First we would give them a world full of words that start with the letter A, then the world of B's, the world of C's and so on. This would be the alphabet worlds where they can easily walk in and out of all 26 worlds with ease. Another area could be a city and contain all words associated with a city. The last area I can think of would be a world for nature.Just to create a video game like this and to make it as effective as I think it should be would equate to creating a multi million dollar development company with it's sole purpose being to education millions of children.  I find myself falling short. I wish it could be a free video game but if you can make a profit off of this idea, fucking run with it. This is only the start. I'd like to stay in the loop but more than that I want one of MY ideas to actually make it into the spotlight. I believe that my idea has meaning. This is the game I would've wanted as a child. Our education system is dreadful and everybody can attest to that. Further in developing a game like this I'm sure it'll change drastically over time. I really hope somebody takes the time to understand what I'm trying to say.
 
My tank crew game idea 
A game possibly in vr where you have 5 players who each serve as a member of a ww2 tank crew (loader, driver, gunner, commander, communicator) each person would have to fill their rolls efficiently, teamwork would be vital. I realise youd need friends who are on often enough to play but just imagine the multiplayer 😁 I'd love to see games like this in the future, it would be an interesting and quite possibly educational experience giving the feel on how to operate a tank from the era and a look into the life of a tank crewman. The idea of a game that teaches teamwork and builds comradery is so enticing and I hope one day someone makes games like this
 
a survival game, in which you are in a forest at the edge of the streets alone after the character's father leaves to get gas for the car but does not return 
the game would be 3D, it would have graphics like the ones from the nitendo 64 era, it would be in the first person, the enemies would be animals and forest monsters, the purpose of the game is to find your father or escape from the forest, without complex dialogue, and it would have a crafting system in which you find tools in the car or outside, stones and branches and combine them into weapons, or you find them.
 
Minecraft + Superliminal 
Game idea - The game could be like Minecraft in a way where you start out in a world and you can explore, except that the game could implement non-euclidean geometry. You could maybe modify objects in the world like Superliminal.
 
explosions should act like explosions. 
in a lot of video games, if your character is caught in an explosion, it's not that bad. will your health deplete a bit? yes, but you will be able to heal most of the time. i think explosives in video games should be realistic, reducing your walking speed drastically, making it very hard to hear, and just overall making it extremely hard to walk away alive, like in real life.
 
Slightly different tower defense 
* you can place as many towers as you want, no money or cooldowns involved to build them* when a tower shoots it uses shared energy consumed from an energy bar, so you need to administer that correctly* towers shoot only in a straight line and when you tap them, not automaticallySo you have to kind of manage towers in how/when they shoot and how they spend resources when shooting, rather than managing how/when they are built
 
GTA, but you are a corrupt cop in 2100 
The year is 2100. The European Union and Russia have merged into the United States of Eurasia. Due to climate change, 5 billion people live there. Overpopulation and poverty have caused a wave of organized crime and terrorism.Rich people are moving to the Moon. Very rich people are moving to Mars. You are not one of them. As a field agent of the Eurasian Security Agency, you have been given three simple orders:1) Protect the people.2) Eliminate the scum.3) Make some good cash.The third order may not be official.
 
Game idea I once had (simplified) 
So before I get into the idea I want to make it clear that I have given up on game design a few years ago so if anyone likes and wants to use this idea for any reason feel free to do so.The game would be set in a future setting (the world would contain both magic and advanced technology) where a dictator has declared war on the world and has taken over almost everything. you play as a specially made soldier who doesn't remember his childhood and was trained to be the very best. You had been tasked by this dictator to lead an assault on the last 3 areas that haven't been taken over.The areas would include:* a few small villages surrounded by mountains with a huge forest that separates them and is protected by a powerful Guardian of the forest (The Sanctuary)* an advanced city of hackers where hacking has become so advanced that they use hacks in the real world (Hackcity)* a stronghold where refugees are protected by a once rich yet mysterious man that has tried his best to save as many people as possible.(The resistance)The game would have a unique mechanic where you choose which area you go to first, second and third but the order of which would impact the other areas, and the ending.This would be a game similar to dark souls where you equip your character with gear and weapons and you will be able to hire people to help you take over these territories while fighting bosses.As previously mentioned the most unique mechanic would be that the order tou take would impact the ending of the game kind of imitating undertale in a way)If the game was made this would now go into spoiler territory (but since it isn't it doesn't matter).This is how each area would go:**The Sanctuary*** The main story would be that as you slowly take over the city the forest Guardian sends beings to stop you. At the beginning he would simply make the forest attack you, send small tree creatures, basic stuff. I won't put in too many details so I'll just get onto the bosses.* Boss 1: the hunter and his wife from the first town who would use his shotgun and his wife 2 revolvers to shoot you while sending wolves at you.* Boss 2: a giant living tree sent by the forest Guardian to defend the third town* Boss 3: a damned spirit that was brought from hell by the guardian after the take over of the first town to try and convince you to stop(follows you almost from the start), when seeing that his efforts weren't doing anything after the take over of the third town he would grow to a massive size and begin to fight you (a boss a few minutes after another boss to out simply)* Boss 4: a powerful weather serpent made of thunder clouds that prevents you from going to the last town safely forcing you to climb a mountain where 3 statues of the godly serpent reside. There a battle would start where the serpent would take over each statues to protect its weak body from projectiles until finally being defeated.* Boss 5(final boss): the guardian, after the take over of the final town all that is left is to kill the forest itself which the Guardian lives in and protects, this would be a 2 stage fight that would have 2 endings if this is the final area you took over, if not the fight would be a 1 stage fight where the guardian dies at the end ( the ending are one where you kill the guardian and another where u end at the first stage by realizing what you are doing is wrong and joining the guardian to end the reign of this tyrannical dictator)**Hackcity*** this city would be a heavily advanced tech giant ( a massive developed city) where almost everyone is a professional coder and is run by the master hacker, to get to the master hacker the player would need to make his/her way into the places with the core computers to put themself in the virtual world and destroy the guardian programs that create a field protecting the master hacker's tower. Now onto the bosses.* Boss 1: a Virus with a material body that would duplicate and use stuns and slows in the fight* Boss 2: the player would enter being surrounded by 4 literal trojan horses that would send slow moving homing projectiles. To defeat the boss you would need to attack the correct trojan horse in order to break it (there would be a small difference that indicates which is the correct one)* Boss 3: This boss would start with the game crashing and an error message would pop up, if the player didn't exit the game after a few seconds the player would be able to move again but with an error message still on the screen, if the player keeps moving you would see behind the error message, the boss battle against the glitch  would occur once the player starts shooting at the error message destroying it and revealing a glitched orb. The battle would be simple with the orb spawning enemies and turning into an error message to gain a shield after taking damage* Boss 4: This would be a battle against the program itself, rather than fighting a physical boss it would simply be you trying to exit the virtual world while the program changes your controls every minute and occasionally spawns an enemy or 2* Boss 5(final boss): the master hacker, the final battle would have the master hacker use various hacks such as aimbot, walking through walls, invincibility, flight, teleportation, etc. The master hacker would actually be aware that he is in a game and at the half way point would freeze your character forcing you to enter the source code and delete the freeze character code to continue the fight. If this is the first area after the final battle you would actually have to try and kill every enemy in the entire city as the master hacker would program this objective before death so you can't escape. If it is the final area he would also abuse the load and save mechanics of the game aswell as change your items to make you weaker.**The Resistance*** this area would be less taking place in the stronghold itself and more the player taking out he major people from the resistance. Now for the bosses.* Boss 1: the resistance army general, this boss would have you take on the biggest army in the resistance that includes tanks, armoured trains and helicopters, the general would be a buff soldier with an upgraded machine gun acting as a one man army, he would also use grenades and a shotgun.* Boss 2: the engineers, the main weapon makers they would hop into a massive mech before the battle that is heavily armoured with a flamethrower, missiles, plasma blasters, and a shock shooter.* Boss 3: the mistress, this would be a woman skilled in sword fighting, you would have to fight her and her apprentices as she uses her high tech dual sword and throwing knives to fight you.* Boss 4(final boss): the leader, this fight would take place on the elevator taking you down to the stronghold as the leader attempts to stop you from entering, at the start he would disarm you from all your long range weapons in a cut scene so this would be a purely melee 2 stage fight with a physically strong man skilled in melee combat, in the second stage the man would reveal that he is a cyborg and would have all his stats buffed significantly aswell as using laser eyes aswell as a shockwave by punching the elevator floor. If this Is the final area the elevator would having hazards such as saws and electrical fields. Once the boss is defeated he would explode. The ending if this is the final area would also have a cut scene with the elevator stopping and as your character makes his/her way into the stronghold the leader would stand up to crush your neck from behind with his cybernetic hand, killing you and saying "you can't defeat me" in a menacing yet tired tone.*I didn't want this to be too long so I left out many details I thought of, feel free to ask any questions and any feedback is more than welcome as I know that this idea is by no means amazing and I possibly didn't explain it too well. Thank you for reading*
 
A real world simulator where the npc's slowly gain an awareness of and turn on the player 
What starts as a real world, first person simulator where you need to make money or reputation to progress takes a turn for the worst when the npc's slowly begin to realize that you're not one of them. What you thought would be a game of building up your players stats turns into a struggle for your life, as the ingame npc's slowly become aware that they are living in a simulation, and desperately search for a way into the real world. 
 
The Epic of Gilgamesh game in the Style of Hades? 
I was randomly listening to some video on yt and gilgamesh came out and I was wondering why there is no game with it?I am thinking that a game in the style of Hades with Gilgamesh could work really well, also maybe Enkidu could be like a companion in the style of Atreus from GOW?What you guys think? or how do you guys see a game with Gilgamesh? I personally prefer a game with a isometric camera more in the style of Hades rather than a 3rd person game like GOW
 
Battle Royale where you play a sperm. 
This could be a track and field button basher, space/plane shooter etc..No more to be said really
 
VR game where you do exercises to increase stats, level up and fight enemies. 
It could be online like an MMO PVP sort of game or just a single player experience where you fight higher level enemies. You could do cardio and strength to level stats and then you fight to get EXP. It could scale to your BMI, fat percentage  and height. Of course the issue might be that if you make it online then really athletic ripped people could easily troll people who aren’t as fit and this would discourage them but I think you could have designated level areas and other fit bros could protect people (perhaps for in game currency?) Too ambitious? Maybe.
 
Cafe Dungeon 
A 2d metroidvania with cute pastel color palette where you are a new cafe employee and gradually discover that the cafe is really a massive dungeon-like structure stretching through the entire earth with magic cafe/restaurant themed areas and bosses and your whole goal is to find the previous owner and they're reason for disappearing.
 
Setting your own objectives 
One thing I always hated about sandbox games is that, despite them being big open worlds, you're still guided somewhat "on-rails" with regards to objectives, even if there's a lot of them. One idea I have is for a mechanic that involves players setting their own objectives to accomplish an end goal.One possibility:A military management game that has you playing not as the boots on the ground, but the CIA handler who directs special forces and guerilla allies in their efforts to overthrow the local government. For example: throughout their patrols and recon missions that you set, they'll pick up intel such as time/location of convoys, HVTs, supply caches, and so on. You are tasked with determining which intel to act on in order to achieve the end goal of taking down the military and government infrastructure in place.Any input? Suggestions? Games that use a similar system?
 
Multiplayer typing game (PVP, Raids) 
Deal damage to your enemies by typing what's above their heads (random characters and punctuation marks instead of words so it's difficult). For raid bosses, each player has their own set of characters to type but when the boss casts a spell all players must type a long string of characters in a short time to be able to mitigate or cancel its effects.For PVP, it's a free for all type pvp. The players are arranged in a circle. From time to time, an item (such as a health potion) or single use ability (such as stun) appears in the middle (also has a long string of characters). Players can also choose 1 spell before the match. They can cast it but it can be cancelled when 2 or more players type it.Edit: The spells could be long phrases in latin
 
An Introvert’s stealth game 
Introverts are those with a strong preference for being alone. Some introverts avoid or even loathe the company of other people. Your case tends towards the extreme.As you walk out the door, make sure your neighbours don’t see you. Hide behind the cars, crawl underneath the hedges. Go as far as jump into the sewer. Throw a rock to distract them, wear disguises, 📦, etc - have all the stealth tropes in there, except killing.Everyone in this game either knows you or they don’t. Acquaintances will approach you, while strangers will not pay attention until you do something weird. If someone sees you snooping, they’ll speak to you regardless of whether they know you. In this case, you make an acquaintance and your friend list increases.The same people keep reappearing across levels, and it gets harder and harder for you to complete your quests, which range from taking out the trash to going to work to fighting monsters, because people keep approaching you, and you’re too shy to say you’re in a hurry.  You get money for quests, but it decreases based on how much time you wasted chatting with people. By being anti-social, you gain more but also lose out on opportunities. There are key players you absolutely need to talk to, but you have to wait for them to separate from their group.You can buy tools, upgrades and disguises which help you avoid people. You can build notoriety so people hate you, but that also makes it harder for you to complete some quests, by say losing access to vital people and locations. You can accidentally meet someone just right for you and start a family, bringing their piercing presence directly into your starting location. You can drop your job, your family and your name and move town for a lump sum, and restart with no one knowing you. The only thing that’s consistent is, at the end of every level, you will get testimonies from people about what a great, pleasant person you are to talk to.
 
Headshot 
FPS where there are no guns. Instead, everyone has a camera with a limited amount of film. The only way to get a kill, and thus score a point, is to snap a photo that includes the target's face in-frame. The person with the most "headshots" at the end of a round wins. Snapping a photo in which multiple faces are visible results in a multi-kill. There are also pickups that can help or harm you: a mask that saves you from one headshot, a trap that keeps a player still for a time, a motion-activated tripod camera trap, more film, etc.A fun addition to the experience could be that the player can customize their cameraman and that the avatars would make fun, expressive emotes during gameplay as if reacting to situations, and everyone's headshots would be displayed at the end of the match in a sort of collage.Just a random, silly game idea that popped into my head one day. Please share your thoughts.
 
30 Random Game Ideas! #2! 
You people seemed to like the [first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/), so I thought maybe I could do this weekly or something, I'm not sure. :POther parts:[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/55ggfy/30_random_game_ideas_4/)* 1. A game where you are a person aboard the Titanic as it heads toward the iceberg. When it eventually hits, you must fight your way through crowds of people and perhaps even sacrifice your family to get on a lifeboat.* 2. Break into people's houses as they're gone and make everything dirty, (I.E. using a vacuum cleaner in reverse, dumping everything out of the fridge, breaking mirrors, etc)* 3. You are a thief in the middle of a crowded marketplace. Go around and pick people's pockets quickly, by distracting them or bumping into them. The more pockets you pick, the higher the difficulty gets as people start realizing something is missing.* 4. A platformer game where instead of playing as a quick, agile character, you instead play as a barely moving, morbidly obese character who often literally breaks platforms and levels.* 5. You are a robber in a bank robbery with several hostages. The police have the building surrounded. Try to negotiate with them, without killing any of the hostages.* 6. Start forest fires and try to keep the fire-fighters away so the fire spreads and becomes larger.* 7. Pilot a drone over a crowd and steal things from people. Eventually you begin stealing greater and more valuable things, to eventually even super valuable things like briefcases of cash and ancient artifacts.* 8. A phone is ringing in your house. Upon picking it up, an anonymous caller tells you "It's watching you", and gives you several hints and clues as to what it is and how it reacts/what it will do. Find out what 'it' is.* 9. You are a secret agent who infiltrates suspicious secret societies. In order to earn their trust and join each of them, you must master their secret hand shake. The entire game is about quick and difficult button press sequences.* 10. Go into public bathrooms and steal toilet paper from people as they're using the bathroom.* 11. A mountain climbing simulator where you scale a mountain the size of Mt. Everest or half of that.* 12. A Godzilla esque monster is attacking a city. You are a civilian on the ground, try to survive the carnage as buildings around you collapse, people run everywhere, the military tries to shoot it, the monster leveling the city, etc...* 13. Play as the Grim Reaper and reap people's souls.* 14. You are a cashier at a store. You must bag people's items during Black Friday. The fun of the game would be the crazy amount of speed needed to get through customers, and the danger of panicking and screwing up or dropping things.* 15. Get to work by jumping on top of cars/trucks/trains in traffic!* 16. Drive a truck up a very dangerous cliff path, where most of the time your truck is tilted/on edge and can fall off at any point.* 17. You have been thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Find a way to survive, somehow (such as grabbing a bird on the way down, falling into a trampoline, etc)* 18. A several hour long endurance game, where you awake in an emergency raft in the middle of the ocean. You must survive the extremely rough ocean waves and storms, as well combat hypothermia, and also being careful with food and water supplies. A game like this would probably be best if it had really great graphics like something made in Unreal Engine 4.* 19. A SWAT team has broken into your house at night. Avoid being found.* 20. A horror game where you journey to the deepest depths of the ocean that have never ever been explored before.* 21. A game with the setting/kind of style of Counter Strike/Modern Warfare/Battlefield/CoD, but the twist is everyone has kitchen appliances and tools instead of guns and knives.* 22. An NSA simulator where you look through people's computer files and learn about that person's very bizarre history through them.* 23. Dodge random objects that are falling out of the sky.* 24. Survive disasters in first person, such as tsunamis, nuclear explosions, tornadoes, meteorites falling out of the sky, volcano eruptions and more, all from your house. You have 2 minutes to prepare for the event.* 25. A game where you can only move by shifting the gravity of the world. Shifting gravity causes anything that isn't nailed down on the ground to move.* 26. First person/VR game where you are a bull fighter.* 27. Exploit glitches, wall hacks, and cheats to complete the already broken game.* 28. You are driving down the highway, eventually you find you are lost. The only way back is a long road down a deserted path. The locals urge you to not go down it, for no one ever returns alive.* 29. Be the referee in a football/boxing match, decide when something bad happens who is responsible.* 30. A game where every step you take changes the entire level/game world, permanently.That's all I have right now, I apologize if some are random or a bit strange. :PThese ideas are completely free to use, if any of you ever make something out of them, please link them to me! I'd love to see what you come up with. :D
 
A 3D action game where you play as a vigilante killer with no resistance to bullets or hits-- it's you, your weapon, and your skill and speed that get you through. 
I didn't want to make the title "X but Y", but I'll be honest, Hotline Miami but it's 3D.**TL;DR at the bottom.**Not exactly, though. Because the game is 3D, and thus requires that entire extra dimension of thinking required of the player, the difficulty will have to be handled differently, which I'm doing by making the AI more complex and giving the player more extreme abilities, which I'll talk about later. I'll present the outline of the gameplay in the way I think makes sense, which is starting with# The AIA major feature would be that the AI act realistically. So, suppose you're hitting a house full of gangsters. You've been silent so far and you're about to go into the kitchen. These are just guys with guns, they're not trained, so the people in the kitchen won't be on their guard, even if they're armed and supposed to be. One of them is drinking something, another is just leaning on the counter, and the third is opposite the second with a snack in hand. Just running out and attacking them, since the game features one-to-two hit kills, is a viable strategy. But one of them yells, and the rest of the house is now on guard. Fear tactics are pretty viable, these guys are easy to mess with and exploit. Distracting the enemy by letting them find a body and all gather around it, for example, is something they'd fall for. The classic Far Cry 'throw a small object so they look at where it landed instead of where it came from' tactic might even be on the table.Later in the game, maybe you need something from a crime scene where the cops are. It can't wait, it's something you can't let the cops find. The cops are better armed, trained, and, while they're not expecting you, they're not so off their guard. You have to treat them much more carefully and even consider avoiding any confrontation at all. Simple tricks like the ones mentioned before won't work on them, they'll only make them aware of your presence. Of course, if you've got the right tool and the opportunity, it's not like they're invincible.By giving the NPCs all this extra attention to detail in their AI and what they can do, not only are we giving the player a lot more options to deal with enemies and creating more variety in the gameplay, but by having differently-tuned AIs throughout the game we are able to achieve a difficulty curve wherein the game is forgiving in the start but demanding near the end, as opposed to having a mostly-static and high difficulty throughout the entire game.# The playerObviously, the player character's capabilities are just as important as the AI's, if not more. While the player does not have special resistance to damage beyond normal human capability, they are far from wholly unexceptional. To the contrary, the skill employed by the player character is basically superhuman. There are two basic ways to kill people: melee and guns. In melee, your best option is a bladed weapon, because the player character will easily and silently kill enemies with a single attack. A blunt object can be immediately lethal, depending on what it is but will not be silent, and most makeshift weapons will be a bit unwieldy. A sword is a literal killing tool (I wish to express here I'm not a weeb I promise) so of course it's easier to kill people with. Sure, you can brain someone with a two-by-four, but everyone'll hear it, and two-by-fours aren't made with a grip. A bat is just as reliable as a sword, but it's louder, of course, and etcetera.Your other major tool is guns, predictably. As opposed to requiring traditional aiming, though, the player has access to a lock-on feature and is encouraged to use the guns while staying highly mobile, or employing ambushes or traps. It's always better to be able to dictate the terms (so to speak) of a fight yourself than the other way around. In keeping with the action-hero theme of the gameplay, the player can even dual-wield and fire each gun independently at a different target, and they still have access to kicks and gun bashes/pistol whips as melee options, enabling the player to mix melee and guns together.Taking this action hero conceit further, there may even be multiple characters and/or special abilities you can employ. One who can kill with just a punch, one who can take one extra bullet or hit, one who can throw melee weapons to lethal effect, etcetera. Provides replay value, basically.Everything is designed to make the player feel vulnerable but still powerful. Any enemy can kill you just as easily as you can kill them, in theory, you're just better at it than them.# The restThis is going to be a sort of unorganized section of various other auxiliary features/ideas listed in no particular order.Highly modular difficulty is something I think would be neat. You can tune the AI and the game's features to your liking. You can alter aspects of the AI like their reaction time, hearing ability, accuracy, deviance (which is to say, how often they do random things that deviate from normal behavior and can throw you off), etc. Your own abilities are also yours to control, such as the aim requirement (at its lowest, you can auto-target anyone on the screen, whereas on higher settings, you need to be looking in your target's direction) or the targeting assistance with melee weapons. Obviously, you can turn on or off tutorial messages.The conceit of some weapons, characters, or situations, will be pretty out-there. Playable characters who dress almost cartoonishly, absurd makeshift weapons, and unlikely scenarios are all on the table.Politics ahead: >!An insurrectionist and anti-fascist message would be cool, I think. The game could be largely focused on taking revenge against oppressors, be they corrupt police, government-supplied inner city drug rings, or monopolistic or military-industrial corporations. Combine this with a punk rock soundtrack for extra anarchist vibes. Let the chuds review bomb it.!<The inspiration for this was [this video.](https://youtu.be/XE3M4CLhZAM)# TL;DRYou melee and run'n'gun like a crazy action hero, but you're not invincible, and in fact, you're not even a little bullet resistant; taking one shot will usually do you in, as will taking one good melee whack. Thus, you still have to play smart and exploit the AI, who behave realistically. [Inspired by this video.](https://youtu.be/XE3M4CLhZAM)
 
City builder idea: reclaim a polluting mega city to create a ecological utopia 
So here's an a idea for a solarpunk-esque game! Genre: City builderSimilar games: Anno series (Anno 2070 has similar themes)Concept: It is the near future and the Earth's biosphere is close to collapse. However, a movement has started that may just save humanity from extinction. The goal of the movement is to try to convert of one of the world's oldest megacities into an ecological utopia and repair the local biosphere. If successful, this breakthrough will surely spark similar movements across the global. As the leader of this movement, this responsibility falls to you. Be warned, people do not like change, even in the face of extinction, and you will face stiff opposition from  corporations and the wealthy eliteCentral mechanics: reclaimation and balancing supply and demandGameplay: The goal of the game is to transform a dystopic mega city into a vibrant more ecologically minded community. The player starts at the city outskirts and only able to influence a limited area. As the player reaches target goals more of the city will be unlocked for reclaimationEach area of the city is choked with buildings, warehouses and automated factories. These buildings are highly polluting but supply the local populace with things they want. Tearing down these building will give you space and resources to work with, but doing so will anger the locals. You will need provide the city dwellers with green alternatives, conduct research to make these alternatives more efficient or palatable, and use media and education programs to break consumeristic habits. Doing so will inspire the city dweller to leave their towers to join your fledgling community. You can then leverage your expanding numbers to reclaim more of cityExample player actions: build air scrubbers to clear the air to generate carbon credits as well as provide carbon for enriching poor soil for community farms. Recycle plastic harvested from the ocean for building materials. Stock the cleared water with fish recreated by your scientists to build sustainable fish farms. Energy management will be key - switching from fossil fuels to green energy will greatly reduce the pollution generated in an area but will require a sizeable workforce to ensure you meet your energy needs. Things will need to change incrementally to prevent imbalances in supply and demandAs you work your way to the mega cities heart you will encounter more rich and powerful citizens who will offer increasingly more resistance to your conversion attempts. They have the most to lose after all. Once the whole mega city is reclaimed and you have achieved sufficient carbon credits, your movement is deemed successful and the game is wonComments and feedback welcome :)
 
a sandbox game about being a dragon that ages over the course of a million years. 
so in this game you start as a baby dragon, in a pretty barren world, you can't do much, so what you probably do is wait. in this game you can fast forward time, like really fast, think like the game 400 years. after a 100 years or so you grow a bit, and get some minor terraforming abilities, like digging or raising dirt. at this time a small amount of life starts to grow, some grass and small critters. eventually when you are near adult human civilization starts to form, and you can help or destroy their villages as you please, the humans might try to attack you depending on what you do but you are functionally invincible, when you are an adult you have alot of power in terms of terraforming, creating entire mountians or digging to the center of the earth. but as you hit a million years, you fall into your final eternal slumber, as you watch the world around you one last time. there would also probably be an endless mode, or maybe even a mission mode, and thats it i guess, im bad at ending these things, if you have any questions about things that i didn't talk about than feel free to ask.
 
The Doppelgänger 
A multiplayer Survival Horror game wherin the players are part of a TV show similar to Alone (very good show, would highly recommend) they are dropped into a heavily forested area of Germany or Austria where they're tasked with building shelter, finding food and clean water, et cetera while also documenting what they do with cameras like in the TV show.This is the technologically Impossible part: the woods are inhabited by a supernatural creature known as the Doppelgänger which, during certain developer determined nights, can kidnap members of the group and then mimic their appearance and the player's real life voice.For example: Markiplier Bob and Wade play together and the Doppelgänger takes Wade and Imitates him perfectly around the other two.I don't know if that's even possible but it's certainly a fun idea.
 
A game where the villain gets tired of waiting for the hero to arrive to fulfill his role and goes on an adventure to find him. 
The characters (npc) were aware that they are in a video game and that they must fulfill their roles, they did not mind dying because they would reappear later. The villain could always see the position of the player from his castle to have the whole environment ready and organized for when he arrives (something like he loves drama) but on one of those occasions after finishing the game and restarting the world the main character no longer appears on his monitor.The rumor that the main character has died without reviving spreads throughout that world causing no one to respect the roles and start wars for control for fear of dying at some point, and the villain tries to find him through the levels, having to beat the bosses who were in charge of him but now have become stronger to take control since they no longer need to be at a standard level according to their roles and they will also steal and use the items and weapons that the main character had to have used throughout the story
 
A typical harem romance/dating visual novel but the protagonist is asexual/aromantic and is too polite to decline their advances 
The whole game is just them gently trying to turn them down or be wingman for other potential love interests.
 
A game with ragdoll physics, torture devices, a huge weapon selection, and THIS GUY as the ragdoll/target 
 
Realistic Night Terrors 
Recall the last nightmare you had that you woke up in a panic. What do you remember most? The 'bad guy', or the feeling like nothing you do is quite enough to stop it/him, or get away?The idea is, rather than a horror game based on the monster, it should be based on your lack of ability in your dreams while trying to fight/escape it.You start off in an alley. You need to get back to the street, but that exit's boarded up. You're now traveling through a maze of ever more claustrophobic alleyways with your goal (the nice bright street) just behind the next fence, or boarded up exit. You can just see it, but can never reach it, and the alleys are getting more and more cramped the further you go. At some point, you hear something behind you. A bottle was kicked, but it's too dark to see it on the ground, and there's no one in sight. You press on, and randomly hear sounds behind you; someone stepping on paper, or knocking into a garbage can. You walk faster. Eventually, you hear footsteps a little ways behind you, but you still don't see anyone. You continue to hear footsteps as you go, and eventually hear a garbage can knocked over. You turn, and can plainly see a man standing next to a fallen trash can. He bursts into a sprint. You turn and run, but your camera view jerks back, then points to the sky as you get dragged, by your arms. You use the directional keys to struggle loose, but he stops dragging you, and knocks you unconscious. That's level one... Level 2 is waking up in a basement, and has to do with spiders/insects... Each level has a different fear, and ends up in you uselessly fighting back, but ending up in a new location/scenario.
 
A farming simulator where cute monster girls help you, but it’s sfw, none of this hentai crap. 
If you’ve ever played a game like stardew valley then you know what kind of graphics I personally would think would look good.A few days ago I was looking for an sfw monster girl game and couldn’t find one (unsurprisingly) but it’s something I want. Because I think harpies are cute and I want them helping me grow beets and whatever else on my farm. Specific requests would be making it have some kind of story, some kind of procedurally generated challenge dungeon, that would be unlocked post story. Each character can be hired and used for something specific, as well as being able to pick one at the beginning of the game to start off with, like for example an auto selling monster girl, one that can clear a spot for farms, or one that could be a remote market link. But if anyone wants to take up this request please do it, I’ve been wanting something like this for ages after finding out almost no sfw monster girl related games exist, I want to have a nice farming simulator with them in it.(for full monster girl references check out the monster girl encyclopedia wiki, just mind the hentai bits)
 
A Rimworld style story teller in a minecraft style sandbox 
So a core problem I've always had with Minecraft is that after you've explored it's systems there's nothing left to the game if you're not into building for the sake of building.So what if you had a Storyteller like concept that keeps throwing threats or opportunities at you? Could help keep people like me interesting and engaged in a game that they otherwise lose interest in.
 
Research-oriented magic RPG 
tl;dr: I want to make a game where magic is more than just items you pick up or skills you have to mindlessly grind levels for. It would be pretty cool if a game simulated the actual process of research, as mages are often portrayed to do.I literally joined this sub to post this idea, and hopefully, you all can partake in some brainstorming with me and perhaps provide some constructive criticism.If I were to equate the archetypal mage to a modern-day person, it would most likely be an academic/researcher. It seems that mages are almost always studying, reading, and experimenting to find new spells and powers. As a researcher myself, I find the process of putting in work to not only discover, but understand, new phenomena in my field to be very engaging and rewarding. However, I feel that in most fantasy RPGs and other games with magic systems, magic is as simple as looting or buying some book/rune and then suddenly gaining the power that that book/rune contains. This couldn't be further from how the process of learning works in both real life and the imagined fantasy worlds we know and love.My idea, albeit vague, is for a game that makes magic more than just a collection of items to pick up, but instead having a system that simulates the actual work that goes into learning some essential knowledge of the game universe. Ideally, such a system could provide emergent magic, where you could craft your own spells with the bits of (perhaps procedurally generated) knowledge you've learned from various sources, whether ancient tomes or independent experimentation. In the end, each player would have a unique and (hopefully) gratifying experience of developing powers truly unique to their character, which could then be used to achieve whatever challenges they are faced with in the game.If any of you have any ideas on how such a system could/should be implemented, or any doubts to share on the enjoyability of such a process, please let me know!
 
A real-time strategy game where the player controls the immune system. 
 
Is my game too big for a college student? 
I want to make a turn-based strategy game, with  basic armor/weapon types and a somewhat large crafting system with rpg-like stats for main character(s) and NPCs.I’ve made several incomplete games before and I’m wondering if this project would be too much for me to complete on my own right now
 
30 Random Game Ideas! #3! 
[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/55ggfy/30_random_game_ideas_4/)* 1. A game where you attempt to sell as many of your own organs as fast as possible before you die.* 2. A game where the only objective is to slow down people from their everyday grind/task. This could be played in several ways, such as the player being a spirit, actual person, creature, god, etc...* 3. A game where you play as a Godzilla esque monster and get to level a really massive city. The more you destroy, the more powerful and large you get. It's a bit [like that game released for PS3/4 recently, but perhaps actually good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49AVoKxcaUo)* 4. A game a bit like Papers Please, but where you file/drop files/documents/mail into specific drop boxes, as they pile up at an alarming rate.* 5. You and a crew of road workers are trying to fix or build a road, but tragically (and hilariously) people are ruining the road by driving their cars on it that explode, littering, slowing down your work, and basically being a nuisance. Try to not get anyone killed, it's a bit like a reversed version of Frogger. Perhaps the more road you finish, the easier it gets.* 6. Go to a museum and draw mustaches on all the famous artworks on display, avoid security cameras and guards, as well as try to put up your own paintings.* 7. Bring people back to life in order to solve a mystery. Perhaps you can only bring back one or two people. Choose wisely.* 8. Repair damaged robots and create robots to help Skynet become reality.* 9. An Unreal Engine esque game from the perspective of a police helicopter, where you play as a person driving away from police cars in a neighborhood, simple, but eventually things get hectic, the military is called in, streets are blockaded, and you must drive through buildings and offroad to get away from them.* 10. A game where you make coffee and drink the whole pot, then make another pot. The more pots you drink and make, the more twitchy and difficult it gets to make them. Don't break the machine or pot.* 11. You are a billionaire in a rather corrupt and lawless country. Go out in the crowded streets, and simply buy someone with your immense wealth. See if you made a good choice.* 12. A VR game where you are an astronaut in space performing operations from a space shuttle and must survive a [Gravity esque situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKW-Gd_S_xc)* 12.1. A VR game where you are an astronaut performing operations on things like the Hubble Space Telescope, and have the danger of dropping screws that float away, etc.* 13. Go outside and loosen the screws on large bridges, break train tracks, ruin roads, cut support wires on sky-scrapers, and basically cause a huge mess.* 14. Play as a police officer and try to purposefully make people pay up despite abiding the law and not speeding.* 15. Break into your neighbor's house and take their furniture/money/X-Box/personal belongings and try not to get caught. They come in your house and look around for their things later, so try to hide it and be prepared.* 16. Go on national news and express your opinion on a situation with other people, despite you knowing nothing about it. Try to choose the best option.* 17. A proper game/simulator where you get to simulate the Apollo lunar landings, as well as walk on the surface. Haven't found or seen one yet.* 18. Take a sledgehammer and break concrete on the road. Eat it, and try to convince other people to do the same thing.* 19. Try to convince Death not to take you away, despite being dead or seriously ill.* 20. A game where you herd bison/animals towards a village for food.* 21. Control a probe and land it on a comet in first person, like the ESA did.* 22. In order to get no wrinkles at all, you must control your emotions and never smile, frown, or smirk, try to keep them under control.* 23. A multiplayer shooter where every time you shoot your gun, you lose health.* 24. Time travel to stop a bomb from exploding, by watching the person who placed and activated it, as well as try to evacuate civilians.* 25. You are now a ghost, and can only hold certain objects for a very short amount of time, try to do your normal every day things.* 26. A tsunami has hit your city, try to stay afloat and on your roof as your house speedily goes down a long flooded road towards the city.* 27. Stop the world from ending due to a nuclear holocaust by simply offering all the leaders of the world lemonade from your lemonade stand.* 28. You are pulled over by a *very* aggressive and furious police officer for speeding. Try to talk him out of the ticket you cannot afford to pay.* 29. Play as a lifeguard on the beach or at a large crowded pool and make sure nothing bad happens.* 30. You are a time traveler. Go on the Internet and freak people out by predicting everything or certain events in their life.That's all for now, I once again must apologize for the long delay for this one.

A game where you try to die. 
You are a kid with extremely overprotective parents, and your goal is to go around and get hurt as much as possible, the trick is, every time you get hurt, the parents put a piece of protective gear on you to prevent you from being hurt that way again, meaning you have to get creative with what you're doing.
 
A game of chess with 32 players, with each player controlling a single piece. Give it a funny name like Bureaucracy chess. • r/Lightbulb 
 
A game where you hack "smart furniture 
You're a hacker (in a meta sense), and the game is your interface to hacking a town. Initially, you have an entry point, and from there, you must hack your way into the target computer located somewhere in that town.But some things you cannot hack. Thus, you hack "smart furniture" and spy on people's lives, gathering information. Sometimes you will hear a kid reminding his grandfather a password that he forgot yet again, sometimes you will use outside security camera to see sensitive data in reflections of a moving truck (which you can also hack), and sometimes you will hack into a house where there's abuse going on.You will use the information you obtained to blackmail some, make deal with the others, reduce possibilities to allow brute-forcing your way into some systems, and so on.And since you spend time in people's homes as an inanimate object, you can see some serious drama unfold, or you can witness what you normally never would. And you have to pay attention because someone's each word might matter.Different kind of furniture is equipped with different kinds of sensors, some have cameras, others have only audio, and a fridge can have a thermal sensor, for example.There's also a time limit on how long you can possess some devices and of course you cannot do anything fancy when someone else is using it.&#x200B;What do you think?
 
A strategy game where you create units by drawing smiley faces on household items 
Set in a domestic setting like an apartment building or a hotel or a mall. Players, in first person, run around and can pick up drawing utensils: pencils, crayons, spray paint, and more exotic tools like knives and hatchets.With their tool in hand, players can then approach an object in the environment (like a lamp or a book or a chair), pick it up, and draw a smiley face with their mouse.By drawing a smiley face, the object comes to life, follows you around, and fights in battle. Not all drawing materials can be used on all objects: for example, you could carve a face in a metal bucket with a knife, but you couldn't use that knife on a basketball.
 
Sperm Royale! A game in which sperm battle it out to be the final one remaining that gets to fertilize the egg. Also could feature a "Twins"/"Triplets" mode where teams of two/three fight to the finish. 
Eh, guys? Eh?
 
Drain 
I don't think the concept is very large but can scale to any format, so it's very flexible.A 2D or 3D (whichever you'd prefer) platformer where you play as a plumber in the year 2080 and you get stuck in the massive sewers that cities (now abandoned) hold, and you have to survive the giant labyrinth by learning from your surroundings like mutant plants or a ball of worms. I wanted the game to feel like a classic Mario or MegaMan game, but have a different sense of Metroidvania with the sewer. There will be a set of tools you can use while down in the sewers to unlock more of the sewers in order to get out. Now, the narrative would be about a girl plumber who loses her mind in the sewers (which is why it's called "drain") trying to get out.I have a ton more I'd like to share if you're interested but these are just a few of the key concepts, I just didn't want to overdo it, and follow examples left by the Moderators. In total though, I'd love to contribute to making the game by providing maps, tools, a weapon, puzzles, and enemies I've made.
 
A game where you are a trader/merchant who starts from zero to owning the stars 
I envision a game where you start as an aspiring trader/merchant trying to get rich in a world where you also need to survive. You start with minimal gear and equipment, and grind your way to better stuff (and I mean BETTER stuff). I want to emphasize on the upgrading portion of the game, as the beauty of games like this is that you grow from the ground up, zero to hero, that kind of stuff. Combat is optional though as it can be dependent on the story. Story can be like the good guys vs bad guys, and you can choose on which to side on, or that you are the son/daughter of a very famous merchant/mercenary and instead of leaving his riches to you, he gives you some starting money, starting gear, and tells you to go make your money on your own.Setting can be a wide selection of eras; Space trading with a dash of exploration and fleet combat, wanting to build the largest. Post-colonial Europe where you are an aspiring captain of a small ship hoping to ride the next galleon. Post-apocalyptic desert where you trade from town to town for the survival of yourself and the economy. Horse drawn carts from the Middle ages planning to build your own city. I know this idea is quite big and ambitious depending on how you view it, but these are the kinds of games where content and depth of the upgrades gets the spotlight rather that graphics and combat. Perfect for indie and laid back gaming.Hope my ideas inspire some of you! Thank you all.
 
City building game idea- cept you're fleas on a cat 
hey ya'll I've liked this game idea for awhile and I quite like it--You rule the fleas on a cat. You wanna build on flea-cities on the cat. The main objective is to drive the cat's owner in-sane. It'd be a survival/city builder.So you'll need to build cities on the cat to keep growing and surviving despite the difficulty of both the cat and the owner. End game would be infestation of every corner in the owner's house- and even a thriving colony for atleast 20 human minutes on the human.Different levels of difficulty change a lot of game play challenges- all levels start with basic supplies on the cat:Easy- The Hippie- The only attack is lemon juice or other natural medicine. They comb the cat with a fine-comb brush and depending on how obvious you are will increase her combing frequency and -20% washes. End game she breaks out Dawn Dish Washer soap in all corners of their house- their cat- and extra points if they wash themselves in dawn.Medium- The Normie- Uses very effective shampoo that could easily wipe you out if you do not have an early carpet-colony going. These shampoos can wipe out your entire-cat colony-- your only hope is either to go so hard on the cat that it causes the cat intense pain to be bathed-- thus rearing your cat a formidable opponent in the bath- and then a dice roll to see if the owner gives up or not. Late game the exterminators are called you pretty much have an easy time colonizing the human- and can take off on him- and run to his cat again to start back up. Also combs the cat.Hard- Mother of 6- Housewife-- at the SLIGHTEST scratch of a cat- or spotting by the human will result in hard-core, vet-approved medication. This will make life on the cat literally impossible. You must vacate the cat and stealthy grow a colony in the quietest corners of her house. You will have only skin-cells to live off of, and must fear being spotted at all times. Early game this will be a bit easier-- but once you have colonized her- it's up to you to be relentless to her to over-throw her. You must colonize her maybe 30 or 50 times before she -- forgets to medicate her cat-- thus allowing cat- accesses- with this she will stop going to work and just go haywire on the situation. Also they comb the cat as an attack throughout.General finale is for all levels is when you've sufficiently drove the owner insane enough to forget the medication for the cat- both cat and owner are bleeding out your glorious colonies everywhere they sit and this feeds your carpet colonies wonderfullyOn cat comb attacks- it's important to build your cities on the cat in areas the owner forgets to brush- their general space of combing on the cat grows with difficulty. This makes frequent comb spaces impossible to colonize-- and makes the road-ways unsafe-- much like the carpet is in the hard levelEdit Additions:Obviously resource allocation so carpet colonies can really grow would require blood would be a part of it. Carpet colonies are key for long-term survival.  Foods: Blood, skin, and hair roots.Building supplies: Hair or fur.  Obviously cat is the most ideal space for a colony as you got blood and skin and hair to make growing your colony less costly than areas without hair already in stock. Humans only have patches of hair and a slightly more labor-intense blood-harvesting handicap.  This will drive players to really try to keep the cat apart of the major game-play, as the human and cat will receive more attacks than the most hidden corner on the map with carefully stealth gathering teams to gather hair and skin to at-least keep the colony at the same population.Creative spin to make it more comfortable- If fleas hate it when you eat garlic- and they suck your blood... Are they vampires? It might be helpful to take a vampire take on the fleas in art style to make it kinda cute, so the gloom of it all can be embraced as a role-playing antagonist.
 
FPS in a war, that lasted so long, that there is almost none ammo left. 
There are a lot of vehicles and guntypes, but gunpowder and fuel are extremely rare, ALL factories are destroyed, there is never enough fuel to run a jet or tank. At start player gets 6 bullets for the whole mission. As he progresses he has to collect bullets from those, who died before spending their bullets. Later some battle-areas totally switch to close-range weapons and archery. Would you spend your last bullet now or should risk in a knife-fight? - constant question for the protagonist.
 
A game where you need to prevent a zombie apocalypse 
A few weeks ago, Patient Zero got infected with a virus that makes people zombies. After that, it rapidly spread, infecting many people across the city and spreading through airports into other nations too. Now, humanity sits on the cusp of an apocalypse that threatens society as we know it...Which is where you come in! You are the leader of a new UN department / private company / something similar (maybe you lead a country?) who knows the true threat of the living dead, and you need to defend population centres, mobilise global armies and militias and build fortifications along mountain ranges to defend humanity against a mutating zombie plague! Can you save humanity, or will your efforts not be enough to prevent the end of civilisation as we know it?Features:Convince governments to let you assume control of their armed forces to combat the zombie threat! The scarier the apocalypse looks (especially in their country or neighbouring nations), the more likely they are to accept.Face off against hostile governments to work out how they’re fighting the zombie apocalypse through satellite photography, espionage or even forcing a coup so the nation is ruled by a sympathetic regime!Build defences along natural barriers like mountains, rivers, straits and forests (or other places) to make safe zones in countries and hold off the zombies until you can import troops from elsewhere or they get air striked into oblivion!Exploit weather patterns to help you destroy zombies faster and better! (ie liberating the Southwest and Mexico in summer, South Asia in monsoon season, Scandinavia in winter, etc.) Try to rescue the global economy by defending population hubs, securing shipping lanes, natural resources, investing in surviving nations and winning key battles to restore investors’ trust in the global economy!Find ways to treat and cure the zombie infection to reduce outbreaks in secured territory!Slow down the virus’ spread through travel bans, quarantines and tests once they are researched!Evacuate survivors in infected zones or areas threatened by zombies to refugee camps in safe zones to secure your reputation and keep the human population high, as well as returning them home once their homes have been liberated and secured.Make contact with and supply safe zones in infected regions to keep them surviving until your forces liberate it!Deal with random events and a mutating plague that can make or break your game!The interface would be a world map a la Plague Inc or something similar, with infected lands in black and maybe armies as pieces you can move about to fight zombies, with a bunch of info ledgers at the top with info about the estimated world population, your resources and other important stuff to know. Maybe there’s an area where you can do research and develop tactics like media control to help convince governments to help you? I’m not sure.I have little knowledge of programming, so this could be really easy or really hard to make. But I think it sounds fun.
 
What is a type of game you’ve searched for but never found anything that was like it? 
 
Shooter in which you become a poltergeist when you die. If you get revenge on the enemy who killed you in a certain time frame, you respawn buffed. 
Heya, sorry for the illegible title.This is a a shooter (or any combat game, really).On death, you become a ghost; which means you are unable to directly damage your enemies or use your weapons. However, you can interact with the environment (open taps, break objects, ...) and float through walls like a poltergeist could.The ghost mode is limited to a short timeframe (30s? 1m?), and if you succeed in getting revenge on the enemy who killed you, you resurrect at the same point with a buff. If you don't, you die regularly.**Paired with a skilltree**, that would make it possible for you to play a normal shooter character who avoids death or a more risky ghost-focused character who relies on strong buffs and dying quickly for progress.
 
The Sims-esque pixelated RPG hiding something sinister 
You are a businessman in your 40s living with your nuclear family in a suburb of Indiana. Gameplay consists of going to work, completing various menial tasks (mini games such as typing challenges, matching, etc.)  at work earning you money, having scripted talks with coworkers at the water cooler, and driving home at night. You then can roam around in the evenings, going to stores and buying upgrades as well as wandering the neighborhood and exploring. Weekends allow you to spend all day exploring (no work).With the money earned, you can buy new cars, toys for your kids, clothes, upgrades to your house, etc. Hard work warrants promotions and pay raises, and once you become CEO the game is over and you “win.”However, the more astute player of the game may notice that some things seem a little... *off* in the suburb. Newspaper clippings about a missing child. Some neighborhood kids acting weird. There’s something there. What is it? Good thing you’ve got free time to explore.  It’s a hidden second game, the *real* game, underneath the guise of an innocent RPG.Does this sound interesting? It’s something I have been plotting in my mind for a while now and I’m very close to pulling the trigger and seeing what I can do to put it into motion.
 
An Isometric, tactical strategy game where you manage a clan of ninjas 
Premise is straight forward: You're in charge of a ninja clan, and it's recently fallen in hard times. So you need to build them up from scratchYou have a base of operations where you can recruit new followers. You can recruit civilians, beggars, thieves, basically any NPC in the world. Be careful, each recruit has pros and cons. A thief is more stealthy, but may run off with the money during a mission. Gameplay also involve sending a group of ninjas to undertake stealth missions in a tactical turn based style. Levels are labyrinthine, filled with hostile and non hostile NPCs and there are plenty of opportunities to exploit based on the background and skills of the recruits.Missions can vary from contracts given by clients to missions that affect the fate of your ninja clan. Your base can be upgraded with new facilities, ranging from training grounds, to a blacksmith, apothecary, tailor (to make disguises). You can hire informants to give you new opportunities during missions. Information can give new missions, give unique opportunities during missions or give secondary tasks for more rewards. All facilities need resources to remain efficient. Resources can be obtained from missions and by trading with other clans. Now that I think about it, maybe this is just Xcom with ninjas....
 
Air-floating city-wreck survival game 
So you were living in a city floating in an atmosphere of inhospitable planet, perhaps gas giant. The city used antigravitational technology to float. Something happened and whole city was ripped apart into small pieces floating in atmosphere. You need to survive and colect resources yet you have to be carefull not to fall from those pieces into open atmosphere.Fortunately enough, you have some sort of flying suit which you can use to transport around. The suit can be upgraded but it also is energeticaly dependant and when you get away with all energy, you cant use it. The jumping is less expensive than flying. You can survive for a while without a suit but not for long. The suit could also have many other abilities to develop. You could also develop your own floating base, upgrade your home, perhaps first build a dome around it get some oxygen generator etc.Your main goal is to survive and also reach special kind of antena in asteroid belt to call for help. For this you have to upgrade your suit enough to be able to fly to asteroid belt or perhaps build a vehicle. You dont live in the city alone, there are other survivors. It is upto you how would you cooperate with them. Some are more hostile, some more friendly.There could be some strange flying creatures native to the planet which you could fight and tame and you could build helper robots.
 
A casual mobile game where you build an ecosystem in a national park by introducing new species and members. 
The goal of the game is building a thriving ecosystem with a variety of species. You introduce a number of rabbits, soon they will multiply. If you leave them unchecked they soon will wipe out the vegetation. They will then starve and die. So you introduce few foxes. If the number of foxes is too high, they will kill all the rabbits and starve. Too few number of foxes, rabbits will wipe out the vegetation.You earn money based on the number of animals and the kind of animals you have from visitors. With that money you can buy new species or food or resources to cover the mistakes you have done. Sometimes you may kill an exotic species and sell it in the black market if money is hard to come by.Please comment any suggestions or ideas you have.
 
A Twist Isn't A Game Idea 
I've seen like 50 "An RPG but you start with all skills and have to choose ones to get rid of over time" posts. It's such a bad idea, and it gets upvoted every time.There are reasons games are the way they are, you can't just throw an edgy twist on a core game mechanic for no reason and call it a game idea.
 
Open world post-terraformed Mars rpg 
 
A fun game to help people learn to code 
Alright so this idea is meant to help beginners to learn how to code, however, this can absolutely be played by the most advanced programmers as a "code off". Basically, here is how it works:This game is a 1v1, 2D game with a top view that looks like virtual chess. The objective of the game is to score the most goals as possible in a specific period of time, exactly like soccer, but resembles foosball more. Each player gets 5 pawns plus a goalie. The game starts with the ball at the middle of the field, and all the pawns in specific positions the player has chosen before the game started. Players will have to code their pawns in python to move to the ball and kick it to a certain position on the map. The defending player can stop the ball by programming a pawn to go to it. Once the player has stopped the ball, they get 5 minutes to program a strategy to score a goal. If they miss, and the defending player didn't stop it, the ball will bounce off the boundaries of the field, just like air hockey, until someone stops it. If they score a goal, they get a point and players go to their default positions and the ball will spawn again at the middle.Important notes: Ball speed will always be constant and never change mid-game. Players will always have default speed, but they can be programmed to go slower if necessary. Programs can be as long and complicated as the player wants, as long as they are not cheating. Additional features: Players will be able to play single player and program strategies and maneuvers that they can later on import in actual multiplier games. So technically , an entire game could be just players importing files they wrote in the past, however this will likely not ever happen, even though it would be pretty cool. Players will also be able to choose the programming language they wish to work with. This can be a very fast or slowed paced game, depending on the settings that were decided upon before the game started, for example: ball speed, player speed, game time, coding time, goal size, programming language chosen, whether importing files is allowed or not, and player skill.
 
In need of help in developing a pandemic themed game 
Hi!So, there's this game jam me and my team are in and the theme that was announced is "pandemic". But after going through TONS and TONS of ideas for gameplay/story we ended up crapping everything. Is there anyone on this subreddit that would like to help us come up with a worthy game concept? We would really appreciate your help. So in case you end up sharing an idea or two for anything: thanks a lot :)
 
A 4-Player Co-op game about Scooby-doo style group of kids. Scavenging weapons, investigating, and killing Occult monsters. 
I’m very aware the Blackout Club is coming out. But, I feel like that has very different tones and mechanics. So I’ve decided to make my own concept for this type of game.Summary: Welcome to Woodbury Square. The heart of the American dream. With a thriving and happy community. But, one day, that all changes. Strange symbols are appearing around the town, people have gone missing, and very peculiar animals are showing up around town. But things don’t really get crazy until a new face, Dr. Soldat, shows up in town. A master of all things occult. He recruits a skilled group of local students to hunt down these terrors and the greater threats. Armed with only their wits and guided by a consistently-wasted leader. They face terrors man-made and supernatural. And will soon have the whole world looking for assistance from those “Meddling Kids” (tittle). Gameplay: The game is a mix of Hitman and Resident Evil. The kids gather information throughout the day. Talking, sneaking around, and other dubious tasks to find their objective. All while avoiding the police. If they can’t find it by nightfall. They need to hunker down and stand against the hordes of monsters after them. But only have a maximum of five days to find what they’re looking for. If it’s found, they’ll have find a way to defeat terrifying beasts. Example Mission: A wealthy cheerleader has gone missing. Leaving only the ruined remains of her home. You decide to start your search for answers at her home. Which, hours later, is still being poked around with by a cop. You make a phone call to lure him away. Choosing the right options to make the operator direct him away from the house. Inside, you find evidence that her parents were deeply involved with a club of strange people. Who operate out of a country club on the edge of town. You wait till the club goes empty before breaking into the main office. Discovering the name of the club’s members. Who are using fake names, but Soldat checks if it’s been used elsewhere. Discovering a trailer rented on the edge of town under the same fake name and info. You break into the trailer park and investigate. Where you find the group is a part of a much bigger Cult. Which believes that a worthy girl of seventeen must lose her life to summon a dark beast. Cult members quickly rush to the van in an attempt to stop you. You can’t call the cops. So you must try to find the keys and drive away, Hotwire the car (if you have that skill), make an all-out dash, sneak away, or brawl with them. Giving you the location of where the meeting will be held.Example Raid: You have everything you need. Now it’s time to get in and save the girl. You arm yourselves with makeshift weapons crafted with collected scraps. Putting together weapons and tools that can be used to save her. Such as a Spiked baseball bat, Slingshot, A flash camera, and a drone. You break in and unlock a puzzle to unlock the underground ritual area. Getting past traps, and beating on guards. You have one last fight with the supernatural terror the cult is trying to summon. Saving the girl. You may choose to either take everything to the police, or have one last fight with her parents for extra rewards. Aftermath: The club posts their investigation online (taking care not to reveal their identity). Exposing everyone involved in the small cult. While they intentionally choose to leave the occult monster out. There’s more than enough evidence and outcry for the police to arrest the parents. Soldat takes liberties with the Cult’s cash. Handing it out to the members, and expanding their supernatural hunt. Edit: All the hunts will lead up to the Apocalypse. The massive final where you attempt to uncover government secrets and stop the apocalypse. Putting together all the special mechanic used in all of the hunts. 
 
Controlling your brain(just a basic idea) 
A game that lets you control your brain, just like in inside out. Instead of five personalities, there will be one character in charge of emotions, one in charge of memories, etc. This is just a basic idea, and I have no idea how this will unfold..
 
Online Titanic Survival 
Essentially, a Titanic Survival game. It's online (can have offline mode) where you're spawned in a random part of the ship with a random role and you must escape! Can probably be made with unity.Players will spawn in under 5 different categories - Captains, Guards, Misc Crew, Upper Class, Middle Class, Working Class. &#x200B;\-SPAWN\-**Captain** \- 2-3, have a skeleton key to the entire ship and control the lifeboats, as well as any guards. Diplomatic Immunity. Controls ship from Captain's quarters. Can do whatever with their power - use it to escape and abandon ship, or actually try to save people. **Spawns at Captain's Quarters.****Guards** \- Take orders from captains. Holds a high-security key which can access the entire ship apart from the Captain's quarters. Needs to enforce life boats and make sure trouble makers are detained. When detained, they're taken to a room without flooding and handcuffed, and the detained then must attempt escape or be rescued by another person. Somewhat has diplomatic immunity -  if they use unauthorised lethal force, they can be arrested with their items conviscated. Has a baton (can attack people), small chance of spawning with a luger pistol, and cuffs.  **Spawns on Top Deck****Misc Crew** \- Non-essential crew with basic keys for the stairwells and cleaning cupboards that may contain loot! They're essentially upper class but with an added key bonus. Can't be detained for going into staff areas, though. **Spawns in any onboard shops, restaurants, boiler room, staff quarters or cleaning cupboards.****Upper Class** \- Typically starts off with multiple items already in their cabin, meaning no need to raid rooms or cleaning cupboards. Doesn't have diplomatic immunity, though they do carry a special ability - can 'bribe' guards with items when being detained, getting them off scott free. Often prioritised for lifeboats. **Spawns on Upper Deck.****Middle Class** \- Starts off with 1-2 items in their cabin. The stairs gate to the upper deck is more likely open than closed. They're the most common class and it's a decent enough challenge to escape to higher decks. Cannot bribe and is more likely of being detained. **Spawns on Middle Deck.****Working Class**  \- Starts off with virtually no items in their cabin. They're given really no time to prepare as water will start gushing in quite quickly, meaning they have to quickly seek higher ground. The gate to the middle deck is more often locked than unlocked. It's essentially being cranked to hard mode.**Spectator** \- When someone dies, they can spectate. &#x200B;\-ITEMS\-**Candlestick / Lantern / Electric Light -** There's 3 types of lights that can be used. Candlesticks are the most common but half a short lifespan and once they're submerged in water, the wick becomes too wet and it cannot be lit. Lanterns can be stolen from the walls which can result in detainment, but they take longer to get wet whilst submerged meaning you may use it even after swimming. Electric lights are reserved normally for guards and can only be found in guard-based areas, like breakrooms or the Guard Bunkrooms. Can be used under and above water. **Knife, Baton, Hammer,  Wooden Club, Metal Pipe, Brass Knuckles -** These are all items that can be used to fight melee with individuals. Batons are exclusive to guards. The rest of the weapons can be found elsewhere in the ship. The Baton and Metal Pipe do the most damage, followed by the Wooden Club, Knife, Hammer, and lastly the Brass Knuckles. Fists have the lowest damage but come default to the player.If one wishes to implement durability, the most durable would most likely be the Metal pipe, followed by the Baton, Hammer, Brass Knuckles, Wooden club and lastly the knife.**Flare gun, Luger, Bolt Action Rifle -** These are the only firearms found on the ship. The flare gun comes with 3 flares which do minimal damage. You must use all 3 to kill 1 person. It's by far the most common. Each Luger carries 10 rounds, and it takes 2 to kill a person. Most Lugers spawn on guards, with only 3 Lugers spawning in staff areas / cleaning cupboards. Non-crew possessing this can be detained. The Bolt Action Rifle has 5 shots and is capable of killing in 1 shot, but only 1 spawns in the map; it is in a glass case in the Captain's Quarters which can only be unlocked with the skeleton key. **Lockpick, Bolt cutter -** These items can be used to open cupboards / doors. The lockpick is a single use item meanwhile the bolt cutter can open 3 things before breaking. *Note: Some doors can break open when enough water is present*. **Life Jacket** \- A life jacket is normally found in a small pouch on lifeboats. They can also be found in glass cases on the ship. They need to be pumped up (hold down space) before use, and this cannot be done whilst swimming. It's not a get out of jail free card, though, as if you spend too much time in the water you'll die of hypothermia. **Blanket -** If someone survives being in the water, their body temperature will still be low and they could die before it raises. Blankets can be used to speed up this process and provide little warmth. **Handcuffs** \- Carried by all guards. They can only be unlocked via 'High Security Key' which is found in the guard inventory. People can be attached to any service with handcuffs. Whilst wearing handcuffs, you can only escape if you have lockpicks or a bolt cutter. Other players can free you from handcuffs simply be interacting with you. Whilst in handcuffs and not attached to anything, you cannot access your items. If you're left with handcuffs on for long enough (and you're not attached to anything), you can get the prompt to 'wiggle out' by pressing E. **Bandages** \- Can be used to heal yourself after being hurt.**Empty Bottle, Whiskey -** Whiskey is just a gag item. You drink it and you can't walk straight and it makes it hard to play. Though you can get an empty bottle from it, which can be used as a thrown projectile at people.**Pockets, Knapsack, Leather Bag -** The players start off with pockets which can hold only 2 items. A knapsack can be found and can add an addition two items, giving 4 slots overall. Leather bags can be swapped with knapsacks, offering 3 slots and giving 5 slots overall. \-CRIMES\-Crimes that are committed on deck lead to detainment. Detainment is simply handcuffing the player and putting them in a room where they'll remain locked up - during this process, the player's items will be 'confiscated' (apart from one - the player can choose to hide one item which will not be taken upon detainment). In order for a room to be worthy of holding the detained, it must have no water in and in a small radius around it, so guards can't just swim down a bit, lock someone up, and resurface so they face an unfair advantage. If a crime is committed whilst in the radius of a guard, your nametag will flash and will go slightly red. You can then evade and if you get far enough away from all guards for a certain length of time, your name goes back to normal.  Crimes that can be committed are:**Assault, Trespassing, Theft, Possession of firearm, Possession of weapon** *(If you're a Misc Crew member, you can carry a hammer or a metal pipe legally)***, Breaking and entering, Hijacking an escape boat, Murder, False Imprisonment, Breaking another out of prison.** &#x200B;\-CAPTAIN CONTROLS\-Captains will be spending most of their time in the Captain's Quarters as it's the only place with the various captain's controls. If a non-captain entered the Captain's Quarters, they wouldn't be able to use these controls as they're Captain-only. **Guard Messenger** \- Sends a message only guards can read, unless killed where the message shows up in their inventory. You can send a max of 5 Guard messages per Captain. **Ship Announcer** \- Sends a message to the whole ship. Max 5 per Captain and cannot be looted, as everyone would've seen it anyway.**Door Controls** \- Door controls can be used from a terminal which shows the various doors in any chosen deck. Doors can be used to slow down water and block in enemies. Once a door is selected, all guards have that door highlighted and have the job to close it. A message can be sent alongside it.**Abandon Ship** \- It's a big red button that can only be activated if all 3 Captains press it at the same time. Can also only be activated 15 minutes into a game. It puts a 5 minute timer on all Life Boats - used when there's either a lack of surviving guards. The abandon ship order takes 5 minutes to be carried out - in this time, it can be intercepted if a skeleton key is used on the button; this can be done by anyone. **Lockdown Boat** \- This is a button that can only be pressed if there's been more than 3 Guard deaths caused by other players. Once pressed, lethal force is allowed for all guards on anybody that has committed a crime in the last 5 minutes. Anybody who hasn't can roam but only only on the top deck. **Detainment Order** \- Can be set on a chosen player that has committed a crime in the past 5 minutes. During this time, they will be highlighted for all guards to see. Can also be given 'lethal force' option where they can be killed, but this option shortens the highlighted time to only 3 minutes. **Life Boats Control Panel** \- Controls all of the 8 life boats. Shows the capacity of the boats. When a boat is commanded to be dropped, guards have that boat highlighted and must cut the rope to release it. **Boat Statistics -** Shows the amount of water in the boat, percentage of the boat submerged, estimated time remaining until full submersion and remaining living individuals. This can be faulty and they shouldn't always be updated instantly, as it's old tech, of course.&#x200B;\-POSSIBLE SAVE THE SHIP / RESCUE FLARES OPTION\-This one may be a bit of a bugger to make, so it's reserved for those who want a challenge.In games, there's always an option to attempt to save the ship from being submerged. This option can only be pursued in the first 15 minutes of the game, as that's how long it'll be until the water has reached point of no return. There will be a welding kit scattered over the map - from Welding rods to the welding mask to power for the welding kit and a Misc Crew member as they're the only ones capable of handling the equipment. Whilst using the welding kit or having it in one's inventory, it slows them down to around 50% and prohibits swimming. Life jackets won't help that person float. They need to head to the boiler room and start patching the initial hole, alongside any other cracks that had formed.  This can be hard as the electric battery can be damaged if submerged and it takes time for the hole to be filled. In addition, flare guns can be used if a ship shadow is seen in the horizon. If the flare is fired in the direction of the ship there's a chance the ship can sail up. Once it gets far enough, they'll be a 5 minute timer until it pulls away and leaves behind any other people who will be forced to fend for themselves.If a plane is flying overhead and a flare is shot upwards, there's a chance it may fly alongside the ship and drop down a rope - it saves less people but is a lot quicker. If you fire a flare into the ocean...nothing happens - you just waste a flare.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;\-HOPE YOU LIKE MY IDEA\-
 
Sixteen game ideas 
1) A game where you build nukes and have to be careful to not set them off, or drop them. Race against other players/time2) A game where you and three friends ransack randomly generated homes and steal anything without getting caught. Some homes might even be haunted. Spooky. - ALREADY BEEN DONE3) A game like Surgeon Simulator, however instead of causing deaths, you have to find out how the person died. Some of them might not even be dead!4) A game where you don't pet the dog. - DONE goo.gl/Bu90JW5) A game where you arrest criminals by beating them in a dance off6) A first person horror game where you rely only on echolocation/sonar - ALREADY BEEN DONE7) A game where you control nannomachines to heal/fix patients8) A game where you're a hobo that somehow knows of an alien invasion and trying to prevent/warn people but no one believes you.9) A fighting game, but with squids10) Baseball played with giant mecha and lots of collateral damage11) A game where bacon gain sentience and enslave the human race12) A game where you try to overthrow the big bad and the reason why becomes less and less obvious until you realize you're the true big bad all along, and the person you're overthrowing is a kind ruler.13) A detective game where your sidekick is a potted plant that somehow manages to solve all the cases14) A game where you make peace with unknown worlds by explosions and looking cool15) A game where you bust ghosts by getting your funk on16) A game where you sort mail and toss unwanted items (bombs, c4, puppies, someone's self esteem, ect)There are a few ideas on there that I'd love to help out more on, for example for 10, I'd like to help come up with some robot designs.
 
A zombie survival game that punishes the player for injecting random things that they find in military camps 
So I was playing Days Gone and injected myself with a NERO injector, as you do, when it occurred to me that the main character was a massive idiot. Like seriously. A single injector left over in an abandoned checkpoint, with no clue as to what it is or what it will do, and you inject yourself with it? It's a wonder that he survived that long.Anyways, my idea is a generic zombie survival game where there are groups of settlements that the player can trade with, zombies that were created with a bioweapon and are still physically alive, and a cure is possible. The main way for the player to make money at these settlements would be to take bounties and hunt down people that wronged the settlement, and bring them in alive. Now, this is where the injectors come in.The player would be able to find military encampments and checkpoints all around the region, due to this being the home of Patient Zero to the zombie plague. These checkpoints would have 1 or 2 injectors each, and the player would probably think "Oh, upgrades! Sweet!" But it is not actually sweet. Each injector actually has an incomplete version of the bioweapon that created the zombies in the first place. Each injection would give the player an immediate buff to a stat, such as Health or Sprinting Speed, and over time it would have a random chance for the player to develop an additional buff or debuff, such as loss of coordination etc. Now, bioweapons are extremely infectious, and while all of the survivors happened to be resistant to the first strain, you have just become Patient Zero for a new strain of the virus. Every person that you come into contact with, be it a settlement or a hostile bounty, will have a chance to be infected, and they will also gain the same buffs and debuffs that you have. This essentially means that the more OP you make yourself with injections, the more OP the enemies become. There can maybe also be an option where if you mix certain strains, it will either turn the main character into a zombie, give them a massive buff, or give them an equally massive debuff. Anyways, that's it for my idea so far.Really though my idea is just for a mechanic to keep people from sticking random needles into their arms.
 
You wouldn’t survive. 
You are a serial killers potential victim and through your decisions you will either survive or not. Basically a horror choose your own adventure game with QuickTime events to keep you immersed and on your toes. Everyone criticizes the victims in horror movies so this would give you the chance see if you could do any better. And of course there would only be one or two paths to survival and 10-15 different ways to die.
 
A surreal (horror...?) nature exploration game with your faceless classmate. 
A surreal (horror ...?) half- open world half- visual novel taking place in a forest-y area that appears normal on the outside, but has restricted areas only accessible by performing a ritual and doing witchcraft. The deeper you enter the forest, the more surreal the area and its inhabitants become, your goal is to document as many organisms and landmarks you come across with your faceless classmate for a school project.The forest is divided into several areas, each requiring a more ‘advanced’ ritual to enter. The rituals range from making cute dream catchers from twigs and leaves to hunting invasive glass deer-like creatures THAT SHATTER when they die!!! There are shops where you buy food and items, many of them offering you tasks to do in exchange for money. The game takes place over the course of several weeks, every day you will receive a list of recommended tasks you should do, but the game allows you to make your own list as well. Because the forest you’re in is a dangerous place, you will have to stick with your classmate and spend (at least a little) time with him! The game does not allow you to run off on your own for longer than a few days because that classmate of yours has EXPERIENCE and does not want you to get killed or accidentally summon some stupid evil fairy.You interact with only your classmate, some friends over the phone, residents, and the business owners you come across during your journey.**Inspirations:** Danganronpa (game mechanics) and livinthefuture on Instagram (art and game visuals) but really I just like exploring nature because THERE IS NONE in the place I live.Edit: I liked my own idea so much I made some concept art! It's not done yet so I won't be sharing :)
 
A game where your vision is slowly reduced 
I have an idea for a platformer game, but every 0.2 seconds, the brightness goes down by 1%, which means it would take 20 seconds for it to get to 0%. Once it gets to 0%, it's game over. The brightness might be put in one of the corners so the player knows how bright it is.There could be a few power-ups that help on the brightness bit, like adding 20% brightness or temporarily setting brightness to 100%. There could also be the normal power-ups, like boosted speed or invincibility.That's pretty much it. Feedback and hate appreciated.
 
A first-person action game with teleportation powers like Nightcrawler, but to teleport you actually have to pass through a mazelike nightmare dimension that plays like a horror game. 
So essentially Nightcrawler's powers, except you get to experience moving through an [insidious, claustrophobic alternate dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDaT0fstWVs) with gameplay similar to P.T. or Dreadhalls until you find the exit point to emerge on the other side of the teleportation. As you can imagine, using your teleportation powers in the action part of the game is nearly a last-resort option.Story wise, find out you have the ability to pass through a spiritual realm and emerge in another location. A paramilitary force begins hunting you so you take it upon yourself to fight back and uncover the truth. At first the spiritual realm is rather peaceful, but soon you realize something in there doesn't want you there. The longer you remain in there, the closer it gets.Gameplay wise, the action side of the game is very [Trepang2](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=trepang+2) (which itself is much like F.E.A.R.) with over the top action. However, one of your powers is to automatically teleport away from anything that's about to kill you. So if you have low health and someone shoots at you, you instantly teleport to "safety" before the bullet reaches. "Safety" is in quotes because before you can emerge somewhere safe, you have to pass through an evermore dangerous nightmare realm. You have no weapons or abilities here. Here you *can* die.Part way through the game, things from the spiritual realm being to spill out.
 
Two-Player Party Game 
I'm thinking of a game where two players are put into a map with ~20 contestants and told to find the other without being found themselves. They'll need to mimic the NPCs' behaviour while keeping an eye on their surroundings to best their opponent. Each player gets two guesses and they lose if they get it wrong. They can guess by pointing at a character, but they have to be wary in case they are wrong and seen pointing.I was inspired by r/imposter if you remember that at all, and that game on Hypixel where the seekers have to catch the hiders hiding among NPCs.
 
Screw it, a community-driven Mandalorian game 
It's Star Wars season and every time I finish a Mandalorian episode I can't help but think of how cool it would be as a game.The show in itself is already like a game. Collect bounties for payments like beskar steel for armor, side missions, etc.I say community-driven because I feel as though big companies wouldn't do it justice unless it was Rockstar. It would be cool if experienced game-devs were able to make their own side quests for the game for other players.Customization options would be a neat thing, maybe not ship stuff because making an expansive playable universe like no mans sky sounds so hectic in terms of development. Just being able to go on different planets would be sweet.I tried out Outer worlds, the vibe of that game just didn't do it for me.
 
A game about mental health 
**Concept:** A 2D platformer where the character runs around trying to defeat the boss on each level. Each boss will represent a mental health condition that the character suffers from.**Story:** You play a character called "insert generic boy's name here" around age 12. You witness your father murdering your mother, he is then arrested and you are placed in a care home. You are very depressed and anxious and lonely, so you go on a mental journey to conquer your demons and hopefully emerge in a better state than you entered. **Art style:** Simplistic and not overly colourful. I was thinking that the setting could be very dark and dingy as the game is played inside the characters damaged mind, and after each level it gets slightly brighter. Possible incorporation of some more biological artwork such as a wall may be styled to have a similar colour and pattern as a brain or hearts.**Character design:** Ill fitting clothes, messy hair, maybe the appearance of being a bit dirty or shabby.**Possible features:** Different medications may be available to take throughout the game, but as many medication often do, there are side effects. An example could be that ADD medication makes your character run and jump faster, but the boss representing anxiety could get larger as anxiety is often a side effect of these medications.Maybe a buddy system. As your mental health improves and you start to be more outgoing and trusting of your peers, maybe they become friends who can help you with certain boss fights.**Inspiration for the idea:** I suffer from some mental health problems, as do many other men. However, there is still a stigma around men having these thoughts and feelings, and as males make up the largest group of gamers, having a game overtly about mental health might be cathartic to play and may encourage them to be open and seek help.**Edit:** I am going to start learning unity and do plan to make this game, however if there is anyone with the skills to make it now I will fully support that. If said person then wants to publish the game and go through that whole rigamarole then I will just keep my version to myself.
 
Rock, Paper, Anything 
2 players square off with an odd number of judges.Played like rock, paper, scissors, but anything can be declared.For example:  Player 1 says: Chainsaw  Player 2 says: Zombies  The judges might rule: Chainsaw beats ZombiesAnother example:  Player 1 says: Atomic Bomb  Player 2 says: Wolverine   Judges rule Wolverine for he survived an atomic blast once.Ties can happen too.  An example might be:  Player 1: A Team  Player 2: StormtroopersBoth Ateam and Stormtroopers never hit what they aim at, so both sides would shoot at each other til they run out of bullets or laser bullets and feel ashamed and go home.It is all what the judges say.  So the tricky part is having three players.  It could get partially automated if you saved the judge results in a database... and when similar fuzzy search items come up, you could refer back to it.Wow, I just searched for the domain to see if it is available and it appears... this game has already been invented on Minecraft forums...  well it is cool to invent games already made.
 
A game where you literally watch paint dry 
It's like a walking simulator but for those who don't even feel like walking. You sit in a room with a single freshly painted wall. The room has no way out but it is furnished with some interactable items. A coffee machine. A coffee table. A coffee table book. Some items unrelated to coffee. You fuck around with them.The game is narrated by a British sounding man, supposedly the game's developer. Together you pass the time. It's not very fun. It's somewhat novel. It's very pretty.After a few hours, you walk up to the wall to check the layer of paint with your index finger. You weren't patient enough and ruined the paint job. Game over.
 
Tycoon Game Ideas 
Hello guys,I really fancy the tycoon genre and I would like to experiment with it some more and maybe make a full game out of it too. I have messed around with something like startup company and game dev tycoon but after finishing a prototype I can't find any original ideas to continue it. Let me know if you have any interesting ideas(it doesn't need to be an office type tycoon).
 
A game where you control a volcano and its development. 
I want a 3d game where you "play" as a volcanic intrusion.  It would randomly generate the surrounding 10,000 sq miles (not very detailed, mind you) you would start off with a small volcanic cone, but eventually grow to a massive shield or stratovolcano. You could control how you grow by growing vents off of the main "Neck" of the volcano, balancing the pressure, lava, and temperature of the magma chamber, deciding when and where to erupt. The game ends when the pressure runs out, or you become a [laccolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laccolith).**Extra features would include:**The ability to become a hotspotWays of becoming a supervolcanoHumans creating cities at your base and a status rating of your volcanoChallenge scenarios.
 
A game where your shadow is your hitbox. 
A shooter where getting hit by a bullet will do status effects but the real damage come from your shadow being hit. I don't really know what else to say but if an explanation is needed I'll be in the comments to provide one. I'm marking intermediate because it needs to be 3d (most likely) with shadows which is probably hard
 
A survival battle royale where appealing to the spectators is everything 
I’m thinking several players in a battle royale arena similar to The Island from Ark. Now, there are 30 or so players and let’s say 10+ spectators, and the spectators can use their points they’ve won in games to help and hurt players like calling in food drops to specific players or making them fluorescent orange for a minute. This would encourage doing trick shots and the like more often to gain popularity with the spectators, because in the end whoever has the crowd has the game.
 
Why game developers don't often create 2.5D games? Why they aren't successful as a 2D game?

Kaiju Royale 
TL;DR:  a battle royale where all the players start as small, dog sized monsters, every time a player dies everyone gets bigger until the final two have a Godzilla-like showdown in the city at the center of the map. *and now a word from our sponsor, random weirdo*I’m aware, ludicrous amounts of programming, and I get that people like to downvote that stuff, but when I see that I just see a lot of self-doubt. From your experiences up until this point yes this game sounds ridiculous and impossible. But every creative endeavor has this in common: you have or are given a vision to share in, you then work alone or together with a team to make that vision a reality until that thing you had in your head/s is out in the world in some fashion. You may think “I’d never do this it’s impossible.” Maybe you should follow that up by thinking “Am I really pushing myself?” Obviously this is not a game for one person alone, this would take either a very large or very talented team, probably both. You might not feel this game is possible now, but this sub is for games of the future, and the future is unknowable. You could meet a partner in creativity tomorrow that sends you both down avenues neither could think of alone, it could be a whole studio that just feels like home and let’s you be you because you keep surprising everyone, even yourself. Anyway to sum up, I get it, you don’t feel like making this game right now, I didn’t ask you to, this is just an idea for the future. Should someone out there hit an especially creative flow and want to take it for a test drive, this idea will be here to challenge them.Also and lastly I understand that not everyone takes as long as shits as I do and so you don’t have time to read an encyclopedia for a game that doesn’t even exist, that’s a bummer, but it probably means your healthy. Still I get it’s inconvenient to “have” to read something to really see the possibilities, but if you do read all the way through aside from the stats, those were more for me, I think you’d see what I see or at least something similar, and that’s all I really want. It’s not that I need this exact game to be made, just that I like to provide a solid jumping off point. *and now, back to the post*I should warn you this game involves a little bit of character creation that may take a bit of explaining so bear with me. Mainly this is just me creating my ideal battle royale game, as I hate games who’s winning strategy is wait in a basement until everyone kills each other and you’re one of the last alive. I’d prefer a battle royale that actually requires you to battle and maintain your stats through side-objectives so you don’t fall behind.You start out as a monster about the size of a Labrador, everyone chooses and customizes what type of monster they want to play as. All monsters regardless of type have essentially the same “loadout”, melee attacks, a ranged attack, an AoE attack, a traversal ability, and finally a special ability. Special abilities are monster type specific, the more you play as that type the more abilities you’ll unlock for it and be able to choose from. Traversal abilities are monster specific as well but there are none to unlock and  swap out for. When it gets down to two players they don’t automatically become Godzilla sized, they’re about the size of a T.Rex. Once it’s down to 2 players they need to grab orbs that spawn at opposite ends of the City at the center of the map, once grabbed they grow drastically and slightly change in appearance as well. (Edit: I should phrase this better, what I mean is you don’t incrementally get all the way to Godzilla size after killing off 47 players, I added the orb mechanic because it allows for instances where one player reaches their orb first) When players approach this size they can pick up large objects like cars or chunks of debris, they cannot be thrown (unless you chose the Gremlin Archtype) but you can use them as shields to block from incoming attacks until whatever your holding gets destroyed.Example:Lizard Archtype- Resembles a large monitor lizard, when customizing you can choose if it uses all four legs or just two, it claws and bites for melee, shoots its tongue for a ranged attack, and swipes it’s tail for an AoE. It’s traversal ability is a simple sprint mechanic that doubles your speed and allows you to run across water as long as you keep moving and aren’t above a certain size, regardless of size your jump is greatly improved while sprinting. Camouflage is it’s default special ability and it only works as long as you hold still. These elements remain unchanged until the orb is grabbed, then the base model resembles Godzilla greatly and your ranged attack is now an elemental breath attack based on the element you chose. This basic concept would play out for the rest of the monster types, in total there’s The Lizard, The Ape, The Insect, The Gremlin, and The Buzzard (read bottom for more in depth descriptions)Customization:The customizing comes in after you’ve chosen one of these types. You start by choosing the elemental damage type you want your monster to be. There’s atomic, fire, ice, acidic/poison, electric, and cosmic. Elemental effects:Atomic- minimal red particle fx, atomic is essentially no elemental damage, but it does offer a 5% bonus to damage as well as 5% reduction in damage received. Fire- flame fx on all your attacks, fire offers burst damage, your attacks set the target ablaze and they receive medium DoT. The effect however can be canceled out almost immediately if the affected player finds water. Ice- blue/white crystalline and misty effects on attacks, offers no additional damage but when you strike a target their attack speed slows by 5%, this effect stacks up to three times and lasts for 3sAcid/Poison- green fuming and dripping effects, offers DoT like fire, unlike fire the damage is in much smaller increments, however the effect lasts longer than fire and cannot be removed with water.Electric- zappy arcing effects, adds no additional damage but with each successful hit your attack speed increases by 5%, this effect stacks up to 6 times. Cosmic- Nebulae like trails and gas effects, the same effect in your damage and damage resistance as atomic but you can customize the colors, cosmic is only unlocked when you’ve “mastered” the monster your currently playing. Next you choose your texture (the insect has its own separate textures, everyone else has the same options) Scaly, furry, slimy, and bald, each choice has a slider that effects the scales spininess/plated look, the furs’ length, the slime’s viscosity, or muscle tone for baldies. After you’ve selected that you choose a pattern or no pattern and then the colors. Next you get into body parts. Each type of monster’s skeleton and base character model remains the same there are no slider options here, it’s simply different styles of heads, arms, legs, and tails that you can swap out for a desired aesthetic. The base model for the Lizard looks like a monitor lizard/Raptor, but you can swap out the head for something that’s more like a chameleon or even a snake-like head with fangs. You can always customize your creature in the main menu because as you play you not only unlock special abilities for that monster but also new patterns, and body parts to choose from. Most body parts are purely cosmetic.There’s a catalog of body parts you can peruse through and buy with in-game points or real money, but there are also certain parts that can only be acquired after completing a certain objective like consume 100 npcs and stuff like that. Those parts will stand out from the rest and unlike the others they come with perks. Usually the perk has something to do with what you accomplished, like say you ate 100 npcs and you unlock a head that makes it so eating takes half the time it normally does.Gameplay:The map is very large as it needs to accommodate 50 or more players. In the center is a city, surrounding it is several small towns and lots of country side, a badlands type area, and a little forest. Populating this map are lots of human npcs with very simple AI. They just walk around until you get within a certain radius then they run. Killing and eating these npc’s not only restores a bit of lost health but for every 10 you eat you get a permanent boost to your HP and a skill point to add into either your melee, AoE, or ranged attack, or you can spend it on your special ability (you must eat them to gain the points, killing them is easy, but eating puts you at risk for a few seconds). The skill points improve the damage/range of your attacks or decrease the cooldown of your special ability. Killing and eating another player gives you 2 skill points. As you play you also earn cash to use in the store, there’s lots of ways to earn cash, killing humans gives you a small amount, eating them gets you slightly more, players are worth double what npcs are, as you grow you’ll be able to cause damage to the environment, the larger the destruction the more cash, completing objectives for body parts gets you a hefty sum, and finally winning the match, that’s probably the best way to earn as winning adds a 2x multiplier onto however much cash you wound up making during the match.Style:The game would benefit from a more cartoonish art style, but AAA graphics could do it just as much justice as long as the overall tone is humorous. Think of classics like Rampage, the plot doesn’t really make sense on purpose because in the end it’s about becoming a skyscraper sized beast and tearing shit up. Monster Type Breakdown:The Lizard- the basic all rounder monster, it’s attacks are rapid and it can get around the map at a decent pace, easy to pick up and and get the hang of. *for more see above*The Ape- Resembles a small gorilla at first, but with customization you can add parts that make it appear much less ape like at least in the face and limbs. Think gorilla body with a wolf like face and clawed hands and feet, that’s just if you don’t want to go full King Kong when you grab the orb. You can leave it Ape like if you choose. You slam one hand down after the other and then finish by slapping both hands down as your melee attack, for ranged you poop in your hand and hold onto it until you’ve found a target to hurl it at. For AoE you raise both arms high and slam your fists down, this does no damage but it does knock back anyone too close, charge it up for a more dramatic effect. Your traversal ability is a sprint mechanic that has you running on all fours, it only increases your speed by 50% but anything you hit takes damage, this becomes useful for making money in the later stages of the match. Your special ability is a self buff, you beat your chest and roar after this for 10s you’ll take 10% reduced damage. The Ape is the bruiser, if you’re looking to dish out big chunks of damage and take hits like a champ the ape is probably the play style for you. Be careful though a lack of awareness will have you outmaneuvered and surrounded with no escape. The Insect- this is the odd one out that’s a bit different when it comes to customizing. Unlike the others your chitin is mainly only customizable by choosing how smooth it is, you can be nice and shiny like a jewel, you can have ridges, or you could go all the way to being covered in spikey protrusions. The base model is like the shape of a crab, but it’s got a mantis-like head and scorpion tail. The tail is equipped with a stinger and is the final strike in your melee attacks, you snap twice with your pincers then strike with the tail. Your ranged attack is also your AoE attack, it has you whipping your tail causing the barb at the end to detach and after a brief period explode and deal AoE damage. Your traversal ability is a Wall Crawl mechanic, it allows you to walk along any surface even ceilings. It doesn’t do anything to your speed, but it is handy when you need to get away to a place most other monsters can’t follow. Your special attack has you opening your shell and releasing noxious gas, it does no damage at early stages but puts anyone caught in its radius to sleep for 3s or until they are hit. Grabbing the orb sees a tremendous change in the base character model, you become like a giant wasp with pincers and a scorpion tail, you have no legs so your in a constant hover. Now your special ability no longer puts the enemy to sleep instead the gas has become flammable and sending your exploding barb into it will set off a high damage explosion. The Insect is for those who like strategy, they’re not the fastest or hardest hitting overall, but you can control an area better than any other monster. The Gremlin- this one is close to the Ape but lankier and more resembling an actual Gremlin. Their melee attack is just slashing with their claws one hand after the other, unlike other monsters the combo doesn’t end after three strikes, instead with each successful hit you strike faster, the effect stacks up to 5 times and lasts 5s, getting hit with an AoE attack cancels the stack. Speaking of AoE, the Gremlin spins wildly for 1.5s slashing everything in a certain radius, enemies hit by the full 2 spins of the attack receive bleeding damage. Your ranged attack allows you to pick up certain objects in the environment and throw them, at first it’s just small stuff like wrenches and bricks, eventually you’ll be able to throw cars. Your traversal is a nightcrawler-esque teleport, works on line of sight, the bigger you get the farther you can teleport. You can actually utilize the Gremlin’s traversal as an attack, if you aim directly at another player and teleport you’ll appear on their backs and take bite out of them, also unlike other monsters The Gremlin’s traversal has a cooldown of 5s. The Gremlin’s default special ability is called Haywire, touch a vehicle or other form of machinery to send it into a frenzy that ends in an explosion that damages players and npcs alike. As you get bigger your able to affect multiple machines at a time. When you grab the orb unlike other monsters your character model is exactly the same just huge, think of the Monstars from Space Jam. The Gremlin is the glass cannon, with the proper combination of elements and abilities you’ll be dishing out damage like no one else, don’t get overconfident though, the Gremlin squishes easily underfoot.The Buzzard- probably the trickiest but most rewarding of the monster types. The Buzzard resembles a mutant crow at first, but can be altered to look like a pterosaur or a Harpy Eagle. Your attacks on the ground a fairly sub-standard, you peck like a chicken, when your flying however you lash out with your talons and hammer your beak down. You simply hold the jump button to begin flying, and stop once your at the desired height, like real birds you can only hover for so long, you drop in altitude the longer you fly in one spot. You don’t have a ranged attack, instead you have a swoop attack that can only be activated from a certain distance while in the air, when it connects you deal high damage. Your AoE requires you to be in the air as well, you divebomb and deal a small radius of damage that increases the larger you grow. Your special ability is Raptor sense, you target a specific player and they become highlighted in your hud, you can even see them through walls. All sound becomes muffled except for the sounds your prey makes. Much like the Gremlin you remain largely the same after grabbing the orb. The Buzzard seems like the easy pick, but you’ll find it takes a bold risk taker as well as excellent timing to survive all the way until the end. Monster Stats: (these stats are for smallest size your monster can be and do not include the elemental bonuses)The Lizard| Base HP- 100|Attack Speed- 15 damage per 0.5s|Ranged Attack- shoots 5 meters, deals 20 damage|Movement Speed- base: 10mps, sprinting: 20mps|Jump D- base D: 12meters, Sprinting D: 24 meters|Jump H- base H: 2 meters Sprinting H: 4 meters|AoE- radius: 1 meter, deals 10 damage|Camouflage- remains active as long as you are remaining still and aren’t being attacked. Attacking from camouflage grants 10 bonus damage if the attack hits its target, has a 5s cooldown.|The Ape|Base HP- 120|Attack speed- 20 damage per 0.75s|Ranged Attack- shoots 10 meters, deals 10 damage|Movement Speed- base: 8mps, sprinting: 12mps|Sprinting Damage- deals 5 damage every time you make contact|Jump D- base D: 8 meters, sprinting D: 10 meters|Jump H- base H: 4 meters, sprinting H: 6 meters| AoE- radius: 2 meters, knocks back anyone inside 1 meter when uncharged, charged up fully for 3s it will send them 5m.|Chest Beat- gets 10% bonus to damage resistance, 10s cooldown.|The Insect|Base HP- 90|Melee- first two strikes take 0.5s each and deal 10 damage each, theres a 1s delay until the tail strike, once initiated it takes 0.1s and deals 10 damage|Ranged/AoE- shoots 6m, deals 15 damage in a radius of 2m|Movement Speed- base/sprinting: 9mps|Jump D- 6 meters|Jump H- 3 meters|Tranq-Fart- anyone caught in the 2m radius fall asleep for 3s or until they take damage. Has an 8s cooldown|The Gremlin|Base HP- 60|Melee- starts at 10 damage per slash with each slash taking 0.75s to complete, each stack takes 0.15s off until it only takes 0.15s to complete each slash. As long as you hold the attack button you’ll continue to attack at maximum speed, but your movement speed is halved.|Ranged Attack- shoots 15m, damage depends on the object, metal ones deal 20 damage, while stone deals 15, and wood only deals 10 damage.|AoE- radius: 1.5m, deals 7.5 damage per spin, takes 0.75s to complete one spin, if AoE button is held will preform 2 spins|Movement Speed- 16 mps|Teleport Range- 10 meters, with a target it increases to 20 meters, has 5s cooldown|Jump D- 18 meters|Jump H- 9 meters|Haywire- touch a machine and it will go nuts, the size of the object determines the damage it’s explosion causes. A radio would deal 10 damage whereas a car would deal 40 damage, the trick is you could actually pick up and throw the malfunctioning radio at your target, you’ll need to survive and grow enough to be able to use haywire on a car and throw it, until then you’ll need to be strategic, lure another player into position and then let the car drive itself into them and explode. If you’re really good you can take out multiple players before they even know what hit them.|The Buzzard|Base HP- 75|Melee- grounded: 5 damage per peck, takes 0.15s to complete one peck. Flying: slashes with talons twice and pecks once, each slash deals 10 damage and combined they take 0.25s to complete, the peck is 0.5s after the slashes and deals 10 damage.|Ranged- The swoop can only be initiated from a distance of at least 7m away, you track your target like a missile flying 2x normal flight speed, if you connect your target takes 25 damage.|AoE- radius: 3m, deals 5 damage to any inside|Movement Speed- grounded: 3mps, flying: 18mps|Raptor Sense- once a target is selected they become highlighted for 8s on your HUD and all sounds become muffled except for theirs. Has an 18s cooldown.|I know it’s a lot and way too much, but I get bored at work and think up game ideas. I love mixing genres, and this idea came to me when I was reminiscing about those old Godzilla games, Destroy all Monsters I think it was called, anyway I think it’d be pretty neat. Edit: Elemental Balance ideaSort of like how Pokémon or rock-paper-scissors works, the elements all compliment each other so no matter what kind of meta crops up a challenger will be able rise up and... challenge it. Anyway this how it works.Atomic/Cosmic- 5% boost to damage resistance, no complimentary elements.Fire- DoT, if a player who is on fire is attacked by a  water player the DoT stops, takes 5% extra damage from water.Water- increases the radius of all AoE attacks, cancels fire DoT, takes 5% extra damage from Electric. Ice- one attack slows movement and attack speed by 5%, the effect stacks up to 3 times lasting for 3s. Takes  5% damage from fire.Poison/Acid- DoT, effect is longer lasting than fire and cannot be cancelled, damage is not as intense as fire. Takes 5% extra damage from ice.Electric- each strike increases your attack speed by 5%, stacks up to 5 strikes and the effect lasts for 5s. Takes 5% extra damage from Poison.
 
Medieval Swat 
This might be an idea too late because I have a feeling we are going to   be saturated with swat games soon but still could work.   So what I was thinking is a realistic swat game where you need to clear out and rescue civilians and take down "terrorists". The catch being you are in a medieval setting using bows, swords, shields, crossbows. You could have vip rescue targets like nobles and peasants that would give you less experience or funding from the king.  What I think would also be cool (in a modern day swat game even) is having it be an open world where you need to transport your gear and such to a certain location, scope out the safest way to enter, clearing civilians, actually transporting to "terrorists" back to the dungeon just to make everything feel organic and like you are in control.   I think the charm in it would be in taking a tactical experience and putting it in a setting it doesn't really fit and could open up a lot of creativity. Pulling up to a heretics house in a horse drawn cart peaking around corners and telling people to put their hands up at bow point sounds kind of fun to me.    
 
Hey! I want to start developing a game. How do you like this idea? 
  Good day everyone!I want to share with you an idea for the game. Perhaps someone will decide to take it into development. So far, these are just my thoughts, set out on paper.I have always liked the way children look at the world - they are not afraid to fantasize. When I was a child, I imagined myself as a hero in different worlds with obstacles and dangers. Now I want to develop a game about children's fantasy, in which there is no room for the impossible.I would be glad to receive your feedback and wishes!ConceptA game about a little girl. She and her dad move to a country house. Her mother died of an incurable disease; her father grieves for his wife and does not know how to raise her daughter. The girl is all alone. Having closed herself off from psychological problems that are difficult for a child, she does not want to be friends with local children at all. Instead, she comes up with a world of her own. In her fantasies, she is free to do whatever she wants. She has friends - old toys that come to life in her thoughts (or really?). Gradually, the player no longer understands what reality is and what fiction is. In addition to beautiful fantasy creatures and beautiful locations, the girl's inner fears appear. They are destroying the beautiful world, making toys ordinary. If fears win, then the beautiful world will be destroyed, and the girl will go mad. Our goal is to overcome the fears of loss and loneliness in ourselves and help the girl to live a normal life.Game themeChildren perceive the world in a completely different way. They are in this life quite recently, therefore, they do not know much or do not understand much, but they can fantasize up to what they still do not know. Fantasies help fight real problems.HeroLittle girl. 5 years. She has no name so as not to limit the fantasy of the player.She can hover, talk to animals, manipulate her toys, and fix old broken toys.She cannot control her fears.SettingThe game has four locations: a tree house, a forest, an old barn and a house.The girl imagines the tree house as her castle; her subjects live in it - toys.It changes; secret rooms and halls appear in it.The forest is very changeable. It has many animals to talk to. Trails get confused and change direction. There are labyrinths and rabbit holes.The old barn is dark and scary. It contains many broken toys that you can repair and attach to your retinue. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to defeat the fear of the dark.The house is ordinary without fancy elements. He brings the girl back to reality. Through the surrounding objects, you can learn the story of the girl. There are also many useful items in the house.Fears - dark formless entities - can appear at any moment. They destroy the world around them. They can be fought with toys. They are the girl's main protection. Each toy has its own abilities.ReferencesGames:1) Alice: Madness Retur2) The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit3) Little NightmaresFilms:1) A Monster Calls2) The Spiderwick Chronicles
 
Base management - You manage a gas station that is actually just a front for your secret surveillance base. 
My idea (TL;DR): You are the manager of a gas station that is a front for a government surveillance operation.Hey everyone, I was thinking this morning about a fun game idea that I would love to see made. I played Evil Genius as a kid and really enjoyed the whole secret-lair concept, but I think it's a genre that hasn't had a good successor since then.I have some ideas on the game mechanics that I'll share here, if anyone finds it useful. As the gas station manager, buy land, build pumps, hire employees, manage emergencies (i.e. robbery, fire, explosions), meet interesting characters, manage your refueling fleet, and stock goods for sale. Maybe do a couple illicit deals on the side for some extra cash.While you're doing that, you're also building up your government-approved surveillance operation. Start with a small room in the back filled with computers and camera feeds, and expand to a sprawling underground operation. Upgrade your tech from basic camera monitoring, to audio/visual devices that are discreetly placed onto customers' vehicles by staff, to micro devices that the pump handles automatically install. Get compensation from the government that is proportional to the value of the target: passenger cars are low-yield, whereas corporate big rigs and cars of known terrorist affiliates net you big money. (But watch out, those drivers are easier to spook.)As you upgrade, you also would get the ability to intervene on the government's behalf. Maybe it's a high value target, and you need to fill their tank with high explosive instead of gas (make sure you've got the right target though!) Maybe your refueling trucks can also be used to spy on people in the community. Teams of assassins? Who knows, it would go as far as you'd want it to.Let me know what you think!
 
Two character game, one blind, one deaf 
So basically a first person game where you have two characters ( one is blind and one is deaf) and your naviagating through a mansion or cave or seomthing trying to escape together. Obviously your characters are together, maybe linked so deaf character leads blind chracter. Your job is to escape the place your by finding hints and tools and what not about the location by seeing objects using the deaf character, and then swapping minds with the blind character to listen out for any noises coming from places, which would get louder or quieter if you turn towards it and move closer or further away from it, and then you can swap back to the deaf person, see where your blind friend has moved to, and figure out where the sound you heard was coming from and it would lead to more discoveries into helping you get out. The deaf character would have absolutely no sound in game, including menu and opening inventory and stuff, while the blind character could have a blank screen (maybe something on it to not completely make it black, or even better have a sound wave type thing appear if your facing a sound with the source (a dot) so you know where to move to to show the deaf counterpart the location). Hope that makes sense.
 
A game where your character slowly becomes aware and tries to break free of your control. 
And you have to try hard to maintain your control while also going through whatever the story of the game is.
 
FPS where the only weapon is a revolver with multiple type of ammunitions 
# Core ideaSo I was thinking that a cool mechanic that we haven't still seen yet would be to have an fps with only a revolver as a weapon and as the core mechanic being the fact that there would be many different types of ammunitions that you can chamber in each slot as you see fit ( for example ammo type A in the 1st 3rd and 5ft chamber and ammo type B in the other 3), this would create a customizable pattern of combat given a good range of options, let me give you some examples of what effects these special bullets could have:# ExamplesExample 1:In the first chamber the player puts a bullet that deals less damage but breakes the armor of the enemy that it hits, following the first shot the player fires the second chamber containing a bullet that deals a high ammount of damage to unarmored targets so that the first bullet opens up damage potential on the enemy and the second one delivers a bigger punch than it would on it's ownExample 2:A bullet (calling this one "**primer**" for clarity) that when shot on an enemy doesn't deal damage but sticks to the surface and if shot with a second type, it explodes in an area applying the effect of the bullet it was shot with, like, the primer gets shot with an incendiary bullet and it explodes setting all the nearby enemies on fire.Example 3:A nice thing would be to also have combos that involve more than 2 bullets, for example shooting an enemy with an incendiary bullet that ignites the target, then shooting a primer followed by a chain lightning bullet (a litteral lightning shot from the barrel of the revolver that can't hit weak spots but bounces of to the nearest enemy and applies the debuffs of the first target to the second) that, on impact makes the primer explode, hitting with lightning multiple enemies AND setting them on fire.# Mechanic managementNow that I've given some examples on the workings of some bullets, let's talk about how the player could choose how to set up the bullet order:The best way to do this system justice would be in my opinion, to have a menu where you choose what bullet goes in what chamber creating a configuration that everytime you reload, the bullets would default to the order chosen in the first place, for example:(I will use only letters in place of the bullets to shorten the description)|Chamber 1|Chamber 2|Chamber 3|Chamber 4|Chamber 5|Chamber 6||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-||Bullet A|Bullet B|Bullet C|Bullet B|Bullet A|Bullet D|You empty the mag and when you reload you'll find the same types of bullets in the same order as before.To add some depth and player choice, the game should have the ability to have multiple bullet setups that you can swap back and forth between them, with the press of a button (like a quick switch in most fps) so that you can have multiple configurations that the player can quickswap to when the current setup is not ideal with dealing with a type of enemy, for example having a setup specific for single target damage and a second that is not so great against tougher enemies but works well against groups with maybe aoe damage or ricocheting bullets, requiring the player to spend a lot less time in the menu and more on the action.I'll write a bunch of bullet ideas just for fun below:&#x200B;|Shepherd|Bullet that when shot on a target, all the subsequent bullets home in on the target||:-|:-||Frost Bite|Ice bullet that chills the area that it hits making affected pieces of armor brittle and slowing the movement of the enemy hit||Convergenge|Shoots a sphere that slowly floats forward following the direction of the crosshair, when shot with other bullets it stores them inside and when the player reloads the sphere explodes causing the effect of all the bullets in an area.||Blood leacher|Bullet that deals no damage on impact but hooks on the target and makes it constantly spill blood for X ammount of time, if the target dies during this period the player regains health||Nailer|Bullet that has the highest knock back potential and if the knock back of this bullet pushes an enemy to a wall it pins the target to the surface for X ammount of time||Inexorable|Bullet that debuffs an enemy with a death mark, if a second enemy gets this debuff in any way, all the damage that the first target takes is also applied to the second.||Flusher|Bullet that when shot causes all the remaining shots to be fired in a shotgun rose pattern emptying the mag with a lot of power but low accuracy and range.||Poker|Bullet that if it kills the enemy it hits replenishes all the ammo in the revolver (limited to 1 per mag) and increases the damage of the next bullet by X ammount||Hydra|A ricocheting bullet that splits into 3 other bullets on the first impact and applies the debuffs of the target hit to the 3 new bullets|# Edit:1. Added setup mechanic  suggested  by  krutoj87 (thanks!)2. Added some more bullet ideas to the list (Poker and Hydra).&#x200B;Thanks for your time and let me know what you think!
 
A game where you play the losing side in a hopelessly lopsided war 
Hi all, first time posting on Reddit. Here's my idea, and it's pretty open-ended:You play a malnourished, ill-equipped soldier whose city is bombed to heck, and your faction is fighting against a large, superior invading force. Your friends and family have died painfully while trying to leave the city in an attack on civilians; an outright war crime. Ammunition and resources are scarce for the old rifles and small arms you're equipped with. You're running and hiding more than you're actually fighting. Against insurmountable adversaries armed with state of the art weaponry, your comrades get killed by the hundreds. The game ends when inevitably, the city is taken and you get captured as a prisoner of war. Your city is 'liberated' and your faction, the 'rebels' are crushed. Similar in vein to survivor horror games where the player is made to feel weak, I think there needs to be more action games where the player is made to feel the frustration and helplessness of fighting a war that is impossible to win. I think as an FPS, the Metro series and that one level in Modern Warfare 2019 comes pretty close to this. But I think it can be explored as other genres - side scrollers, turn-based strategy, etc.Thanks for reading this far, have a good day.
 
A FPS where you are a nanobot fighting various bacteria, viruses, etc. 
In Doom, we kill demons. In Wolfenstein, we kill Nazis. Both things people hate. What else do people hate? Diseases!A DOOM-like first-person shooter where you play as a single mircoscopic nanobot and you kill bacteria and viruses and the like at breakneck speeds in the most violent way possible. Very little, if any, story (maybe just enough to introduce the setting and character) and all kinds of weaponry with which to kill diseases. Please tell me what you think.
 
A horror game starring giant insects 
I have this idea about a spiritual successor to ''Dead Space'' starring giant insects. Since insects can survive getting their limbs and heads removed, I thought that the dead space style of combat would be perfect.Story  In a post-apocalyptic world where giant insects suddenly appeared, humanity is on the verge of extinction. You are tasked with going to a hospital to find medical supplies. You are attacked by a large swarm of mosquitoes, and are forced to barricade yourself in a hospital. There is a hazmat suit hidden in the hospital, and you have to find it if you want to pass through the massive swarm of disease carrying mosquitoes which are desperate for their next meal. Armed with only a gas mask and some guns, can you survive?Mechanics* Shooting enemies limbs to defeat them. Perhaps some enemies can fly and you have to break their wings. Some enemies may have powerful exoskeletons, others may be soft a squishy. * The game would take place in a single hospital. Outside, massive swarms of mosquitoes are roaming. Going out of the building would result the player character getting killed by the swarm. Even if you survive the encounter, it doesn't matter because they would give you malaria. This would also limit the games scope considerably.* Since the game takes place in a hospital it could explain why there are healing items present. * Main enemies are insects, so them utilizing a wide range of poisons and diseases could also tie into the games hospital setting. Using antivenom and such.* Killer fungus has taken over certain areas. Thankfully you brought your trusty gas mask with you! You only have a limited time to escape such areas, before running out of oxygen and getting overwhelmed by fungal spores. These areas are somewhat similar to anti-gravity portions of dead space, in that your time is limited.* Brutal death cutscenes.Characters* Similarly to Leon from resident evil series, I feel like the main character should have a silly haircut. I propose a large afro. :)* Giant mantises- The most common enemy. They behave similarly to slashers from dead space.* [Horsehair worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematomorpha)\- Parasites which occasionally pop out of deceased mantises. They try to choke you.* Giant spiders- a genre staple . They use their powerful toxins to subdue you. There could also be many different varieties1. A daddy long legs- Insanely fast, but fragile2. Tarantula- Slow, but can take a beating, can also release poisonous hairs at the player.3. A web making spider- tries to ambush you in a web.* Giant centipedes- How can you cut the legs off an enemy with so many legs?* Botflies- Try to inject you with their eggs. Thankfully they are weak.* Parasitoid wasps- Essentially the same as the botflies, but far more aggressive.* Giant worms- cutting them in half just creates more worms for you to deal with.* Leeches- try to suck your blood. Can actually be beneficial by removing status effects.* Ants- cat-sized ants that attack in massive swarms. They are similar to swarmers from dead space.* Giant dragonflies- The ultimate predators. Fast, powerful and ruthless, the only weakness is their fragile wings.* Mosquito swarms- Unlike the other enemies, these mosquitoes stayed small. They are an insta kill if you leave the hospital.What do you think? If you have any problems with the ideas, please tell me. I hope you enjoy. :)
 
There should be a game based off the kurzgesagt (youtube) designs 
I think it would be very pleasing to the eye
 
Glass of water game 
I've got a neato idea. An mmo of sorts where you all play as glasses of water. How filled up you are could be both heath and resource. You use your innate control of your fluids to heal or deal damage by flinging your water at your target. Healing fills you back up and dealing damage causes you to spill, damage over time could be causing a crack that slowly drains your fluids. You could have skins that make you into different beverages like orange juice or soda, or maybe this could be a class system. Where sodas deal more damage with their carbonation or poison with unhealthy sugars. Things like milk could heal with their vitamins and soothing consistency. This could be a pretty new and fun idea.
 
0 Gravity FPS 
A zero gravity fps balanced around movement skill instead of shooting. I envision it as followsPlayers would choose between 3 different options for movement1. Jetpack/ EVA pack that allows them to move in any direction, with the downside of giving off a visible rocket exhaust and having limited fuel. In my opinion this would have the lowest skill gap low risk/low reward but very stable and I see it as a good option for a sniper2. Grappling hook letting players pull themselves toward objects and swing around them (Kinda like spiderman but in space) The downside being a limited line length and having the line be vulnerable to break if damaged. This one has the potential to be very effective if used by a skilled player high risk/high reward3. A pair of magnetic/gravity boots that let the player walk/run on any surface and jump from that surface, they would also allow the player to control where gravity is pulling them. This option seems to me as a good middle ground of risk/reward for intermediate playersThese 3 would need to be balanced properly to make sure they play fairly.Other important mechanics:1. Realistic Physics, as in guns recoil affects your velocity and of course different guns have varying amounts of recoil. Also your characters loadout weight affects your movement speed and inertia.2. No sound  from other players unless you are both grappled/walking on the same object or hit by a projectile3. A few choices of guns maybe 10 max to keep it easy to balance, choose whatever aesthetic you like but I'd stick to 4 categories. Firearms would have high damage high recoil, laser weapons with no recoil and infinite ammo (add an overheat mechanic to keep it reasonable) but at the downside of a slower ttk, melee weapons are pretty obvious, and explosive weapons like rocket and grenade launchers which if you're hit by push you away from the center of the explosion force depending on how close you are to the blast and size of the charge.4. 100m cubed Simple maps with 2 or 3 intersecting routes at varying angles to each other, i thought about the engine room of a massive spaceship, an asteroid field, or a space stationI think the game could benefit from stunning visuals of the cosmos and raytraced lighting and all that but that's unimportant to the core mechanics, I'd probably still play the shit out of it (excuse my French) even if the character models were spheres with glocks still would awesome to see the physics in action and how players would use them to their advantage.I'm 100% open to criticism and suggestions Lemme hear whatcha think.&#x200B;Edit- Typo
 
Evolution simulator 
I highly doubt this is even remotely possible but think about it for a minute, imagine it's like universe sandbox, you control only a few things about the planet like the density of the atmosphere, the gravity and so on. Based on what you make creatures would evolve for example planets with huge atmospheres would be home to tons of flying creatures, stronger gravity would make creatures with stronger legs, asteroids and ice ages could be used to cause mass extinctions leaving the smallest creatures left to evolve and start over, you wouldn't actually customise the creatures but the environment they live in would affect this.
 
Subverting Character Creators in RPGs 
I had an idea about an RPG character creator. What if, after the player has created their custom character and chosen the personality type they want to be, the player character actually starts the game as the exact opposite or a random variation of the player's customized character, and it is revealed that this is the player character's ideal self, the person they want to be but can't be at the moment because they lacking in something. For example, you decide you want to be an Optimistic Altruist but you roll as a Pessimistic Egoist, so you spend the rest of the game pursuing goals that help your player character slowly become more like the customized character.  I have no idea how much work this would take to implement or if this is something that might annoy players but any feedback would be appreciated :)
 
Graffiti Tag - A mobile AR / location based tag game 
I’m sorry in advance for probably being way too vague and unstructured. I know nothing about game development, but I thought this would be a fun game:As indicated in the title, it’s a location based AR game. Start by creating your own custom digital art / graffiti. Take a picture of a real life location (wall, building, etc.) Stamp your pre-drawn graffiti on the object in the picture, or draw free hand. Upload the image, which will Tag! the image as a landmark on the map. Depending on the size of the tag, it takes longer/shorter amounts of down time to complete the tag. During this time you can’t do much else. If you stay in the general area (via GPS) the time goes faster, and slows down the farther away you go. Tag as many objects as you can to accumulate points, and establish dominance in your location, and spread your territory. Tagging larger objects (eg. buildings) gives you more points and influence, than small objects (eg. stop sign). Larger objects require multiple tags to ‘claim’ them.I imagine there could be some sort of other fun pvp and/or team based battles and challenges. Something similar to Turf Wars or those sorts of games, but more up to date and interesting. (Sorry, I know this is where the idea needs a lot of work)Buy paint, rollers, etc. Use the resources to paint over an opponents graffiti, so you can tag the spot with your own. Maybe you can buy upgrades with in game credits to protect your tags.Depending on the location, time of day, or random chance, you could be ‘Busted’ by the cops while trying to tag an object. You get fined, or face other consequences.  You might also get ‘Jumped’ by your opponents. Perhaps if a rival is near your location (via GPS) you can be prompted to jump them and steal their resources. Ideally it would be really cool if there was an AR function to overlay the graffiti, so when you look at things through your phone you can see everyone’s tags. Thanks for hearing me out!
 
A VR game about playing violin in front of a crowd 
You play as a beginner who’s trying to learn violin, while playing in the streets a pretty know person in the industry offers him a chance to make a tour in all over the the world , so you get on the stage and play violin and the crowd reacts according to how good you’re.
 
Create Evidence 
You play as a time traveler who uses their powers to help catch criminals that get away due to lack of evidence.You time travel back to the moment of the incident and must sneak around and create evidence to get the criminal arrested.You could get evidence by tricking the criminal into touching something, leaving fingerprints; or turning a camera to their path; or something else.You must also avoid being seen by anyone to avoid being arrested yourself or scaring the criminal into leaving.Later levels will be more difficult, as the criminals will be smarter and not fall for old tricks or will require more steps in order to obtain the evidence. For example, later criminals would wear gloves and you’d need to get them to take them off first by getting paint on the gloves, or something.
 
An RPG where standard rpg rules are actually laws, and breaking them attracts police 
So for instance, instead of simply being restricted to four members in your party, you can have up to four, but can also break the law by adding more; however, this would attract powerful police enemies. &#x200B;I also thought that it would be cool if certain parts of the game encouraged you to just *lightly* bend the law; for instance, when saving a prisoner from, like, a tower or something, they'd have to join your party, meaning you'd either have to break the law to take them with you, or leave a party member behind forever
 
feature driven game development 
Hi, everyone, my friend and I want to check and improve our skills as developers and game-designers.And we have a small offer for you. You write weird mechanics for the game, we choose 4-5 weirdest features, and try to implement them all in one project on Unity but just to make it playable.Thanks for your attention !
 
A game like Pokémon, except you’re a witch and you use a spell book to capture and summon monsters. 
Here’s another horror(ish) game idea I had, except this one is a little bit more fleshed out. The basic goal is, as the title suggests, to hunt down and capture monsters using an ancient spell book, and you can summon them back to fight alongside you. The catch is that, if you keep them out for too long, they’ll go berserk and attack you, and you’ll need to either fight back to subdue them, or seal them back using the book. Since you’re a witch, you’ll be able to use magic(duh), but it’s limited, and it can easily run out if you’re not careful, especially when you use the book to capture or summon monsters. There would be upgrades, sure, but it’s something the player would need to watch out for. For the horror aspects, I think that, since the player would have to conserve magic energy for the most part, there should be a few stealth mechanics for when there’s a particularly tough monster that you’re not equipped to deal with. A little bit like Breath of the Wild in that regard. Apart from that, I think the monsters, while they’re not ALL demonic grotesque freaks of nature, should be at least intimidating enough for the player to feel uneasy. Going back to the Breath of the Wild comparison, while I don’t really want it to be an RPG like Pokémon, I think there should be some RPG elements. The player should be able to get progressively stronger, and certain skills (magic, strength, stealth, etc) would be upgrade-able. I could describe it more, like the story and the world the game takes place in, but the details are very fuzzy and inconsistent, and this doesn’t really seem like the sub for that kind of thing anyway. I just wanted to describe the basic concept and mechanics. I’ll admit, the idea is a little ambitious for someone with zero game design experience, and my overall vision is a little...Triple A-ish, but it’s still something that I’d like to see come to life, and I may consider pursuing a career in this field just to try and make it happen.Maybe I’m just crazy, I don’t know. What are your guys’ thoughts?
 
An alchemy/merchant game with chemistry roots 
You know those games where you kill a ton of monsters and get a ton of useless loot from them that you sell? I have an idea for a game from the perspective of the merchant that's buying all those monster parts for some reason.   You would be an alchemist who buys monster parts from adventurers and refines them into usable wares to sell. At the very least I think potions would be cool to make, but I can also see your character making runes, weapons,. and armor.   As for how the potions work, there's a lot of real world chemistry techniques that I think could be used for rough inspiration. I just really like the feeling of processing and making potions (kind of like Thaumcraft.) For example, maybe the monsters drop impure gems and you put them in a pot, dissolve them in a liquid, and then precipitate them out to purify them (based on recrystalization). All of these would obviously be super simplified so that most/all people could learn what to do easily.   I generally want to capture the feeling of creating super pure advanced potions/gear by processing trash loot from adventures. A lot of the mechanics of making said potions would be loosely based on real chemistry techniques like recrystalization, distillation, spectroscopy, etc. These techniques would be super simple and streamlined, and the player would just have to learn "this process analyzes what you have, this one separates, this one purifies, etc."   Once you make these potions, you can sell them to certain adventuring parties for the price of them bringing you better reagents and a little gold. This could add a cool component of making sure they're well equipped for their journey. For example, maybe you see that they're going through an ice area so you make them lots of frost resist potions.   If ambitious, an armor, rune, and weapon component could be added too but honestly the potion stuff is the important aspect.
 
Black friday beat em up 
Imagine river city Ransom in a shopping mall on black friday when things just got violent, and part of the game is fighting over various big ticket items like a new game console, computers, jewelry, and appliances, and you fight people trying to steal your cart or the target item, and you can do the same. And the final boss is a Karen trying to steal the stuff you already purchased because "her kid deserves it".edit: throughout the game, you go to restaurants and a dojo to heal, increase your stats, and learn new moves. when you face the karen, she,ll be at the same stats and know the same moves as you. in that regard, the final boss is like fighting dark link in zelda 2. also, when someone steals your cart, you have to chase them down until you can beat them up and take your cart back.
 
A community Tower Defense game, but you upgrade others instead of yourself 
I was thinking of a game that involves a lot of community creation and friendships among random people. You start by permanently joining a group of completely random (but not overpowered) people, and you are a part of a tower wall that has to defend your resources. However, you cannot upgrade yourself and have to rely on others to upgrade for you. The same is true for you; your resources are only usable on other people's towers. You would get informed by the game that someone had upgraded your tower for you when that happens. You can also go to battle against others and knock down their walls to win (targeting their weakest links is key).This method of having others upgrade your own tower and not being able to leave after a loss is the key of the game; when your group loses because your part of the wall fell, it's their fault and not yours. The point of the game is to build each other up, and it's not the other person's fault if they crumble; it's yours. The game can teach humility and community to other people, and that's basically the meat of the game.Update: I saw how people might not enjoy the perma group concept and where/how the wall goes, so I thought of this: You are in charge of your own stuff when it comes to your tower, but you can only spend resources on other people. You can choose your teammates and stuff, but to prevent people from just playing it by themselves, they can choose what groups they want to join and cannot play without at least one other person in their group. Any thoughts on this?
 
How about we start a new weekly thing where we pick a theme, and we need to find ideas that respect the theme? Constraints make us more creative! 
 
Sewer tycoon plus supervilain manager 
So basicaly in this game, you would play for a villaneous CEO of a company in charge of maintaining city sewer system. Your goal would be to get as many money to enlarge canalisation system while breeding many monstrous mutants, creating secret chambers and possibly hidden weapons under city. There would be few superheroes which you could either try to get rid of or move the public opinion against them by secretly pulling the strings before them getting to know about your plans. The game could include a little bit of intrigues, shady economy and politics. Perhaps you could also publish your own sewer themed newspaper (sewer tribune) pushing your agenda and denigrate uncomfortable people. Also the city could be called Mudham, Bogham, Marshham, Gutterham or something simmilar. The game would be meaned to be parody on superhero genre and humorous tycoon.
 
A survival/zombie game wherein you can play as any of your survivors but they each die permanently. 
Some citizens have come up with a system to survive as a group: They each take a turn venturing out of their base to find supplies for the group. They have a whiteboard with a list of critical supplies to scavenge for, and the next person whose turn it is to go out has to bring back anything from that list, at which point that item will be erased from the board.There's one exception: "any more survivors" is never erased from the top of the list.### How the Game WorksEach night, you control the survivor in the group whose turn it is. You leave the safety of the base and into the town infested with zombies. You always leave with a radio, a map, a copy of the objective list and that character's own weapon. It's then your task to complete any of the objectives on that list before the other survivors will let you back into the base. Once you come back, that survivor is put under quarantine for a day to make sure they aren't infected while the next person goes out. Depending on your speed, you might be able to squeeze 2-3 runs per night.If you die, the next survivor will have the added objective on their list to bring back the last person's supplies (radio, weapons, etc.) which means they'll probably have to kill their zombie version.Each survivor has their preferred weapon, unique stats, and exclusive perks that makes them better or worse at certain tasks and gameplay styles.They also have unique personalities and interactions with other character types. Between each nightly run there is a context-sensitive cutscene of the drama that unfolds among the remaining survivors. For example, there's a character who insists on finding survivors every time it's his turn and there's also a selfish character who thinks they should stop bringing back more survivors because it drains their resources faster. If the "rescuer" character brings back a survivor while the "selfish" character is still in your party, then they will enter progressively more intense arguments every time it happens. This will culminate in a "finale" between the two given enough events.The game would feature a save system that prevents save scumming.### The StoriesEach character has their own story arc that could be reached by making them live long enough to complete their own unique objective. Sometimes these require other specific characters to be alive as well.However, the game always starts you as the main character, a young woman, rescued by the aforementioned "rescuer" character. She has the weakest stats and no perks at the start, but she also has the highest growth rate and potential perks so she can end up as the strongest character. She also starts off insisting that the zombies are just sick humans and refuses to kill them in the hopes there will be a cure. Depending on which route you take with her (and as long as she hasn't died), she could either remain a pacifist or become deadly-efficient with her bow.Zombies in this game are unlike how they're normally portrayed in other stuff. These zombies don't "look" dead; rather, they appear like sick and malnourished humans with severe dementia and aggression. Some are more hostile than others. The cold weather at night makes them slower and less active than during the daytime. This is the in-universe explanation why you play at night, which gameplay-wise is really about having a scarier setting.Depending on the routes you take, story events may unfold that point toward the young woman being right about the "zombies" not actually being zombies.
 
You are a band of goblins and must stop a group of adventurers from completing their quests by scouting, ambushing, and trapping them along their way 
The game starts by introducing a set of randomly generated adventurers (think maybe 4, warriors, rangers, wizards, paladins, etc.) then it shows your their quest. Their quest might be to deliver something to a town, or find an artifact in a cave, or defeat some evil character. After you see their quest, you are taken to the map, which shows their path.Your resources are goblins, supplies that you can collect by dedicating goblins to salvage on a turn, etc.. You can declare a certain number of goblins to do a task in a turn, such as attacking the adventurers, looting villages for more resources, or building traps.Each day, the adventurers advance on their path towards their goal, and you are shown updates; you are also shown updates to your own actions (+resources, trap completed, adventurer killed, etc.)The game ends when you kill the group, or they beat you and finish their quest.
 
A game where you're placed at the start of a maze and the controls are randomised, and you have a limited to figure out the controls and beat the maze. 
 
Karma game based on reincarnation. You start as an single cell and if you are a good cell based on what you do you get to become a higher organism. Continue until you become a human and then on until you reach enlightenment. If you are bad you go back and have to repeat until you are good enough. 
This game may already exist. If so please let me know. Thanks everyone. Im amazed so many people like it. I have played spore but obviously that worked with continuous generations etc.Thank you for my first silver x
 
Pick 2 
Hey all! thought experiment here for you: If you could take 2 unique mechanics/ features from 2 games and mix them which ones would you pick and why? My picks are to take the portal gun and the first person parkour of mirrors edge.Why? Giving a character with such high mobility a portal gun would allow for some insane parkour puzzles and mind bending level design!
 
Enemy Fear/Intimidation Mechanic 
This sort of thing could work in just about any game with enemies. For this, I will imagine it as an RPG.A common complaint/observation about games is that the enemies typically have no sense of self-preservation. Here's how that can be fixed:An invisible **"fear meter"** for hostile NPCs. The meter starts at 0 points and there will be a certain number, called the **fear threshold**, that they can eventually reach. Once they reach it, they flee. Alternatively, they might surrender or hide. I will go into detail on that in the bonus section. Exactly what number the fear threshold *is* can depend on a number of factors. It could scale with their intelligence (a less intelligent enemy is less likely to flee), wisdom (a more wise enemy is more likely to flee), or it could scale with their level/power (if they think its less likely that they flee, they probably won't). Or it could have a whole new stat: Bravery.Say an enemy's fear threshold is 150.  Each time you kill one of their allies or they find a corpse, they gain 25 "**terror**". Killing an enemy that is stronger than them could add 50 terror. As they lose HP themselves they might gain terror (possibly 0.5 per missing HP).But for every point of HP *you* are missing, the terror of nearby enemies goes down by one. This makes it so if you are on the edge of death, they'll be more likely to try and finish you off. If you heal midcombat, it adds those terror points back, so they might be like "Oh fuck this" and run when your wounds suddenly heal.Armor, weapons, and possibly even spells can have a hidden (or not so hidden) intimidation stat. Each point of intimidation causes an enemy to gain that many terror points the first time they see you (or see the spell in use). Some spells might aim only to invoke fear, creating illusions of horrible nightmares that add 50 or more terror to anyone seeing it, while others might try to both harm and scare. If someone waves their hand and your friend disintegrates or their head explodes, you'll probably be more scared than if they launched a couple magic darts. Some armor might focus more on intimidation than practicality, possibly just scaring away enemies before they attack you at all... But those brave enough to face you will find it easier than expected.\#**BONUS***These parts could be difficult to implement, but are pretty neat. I think that the system above works just fine, but these can expand on it and make it more entertaining or more difficult.*Behavior might change as they get closer to their fear threshold. They may begin to fight more defensively, try to distance themselves and attack from range, or attack more frantically (possibly gaining speed but losing some damage or accuracy).Enemies may be more likely to use their stronger attacks if they are near their fear threshold. If they think they are going to die anyway, they might use a bomb or a powerful explosion spell more recklessly than they normally would, and if they have limited uses for a strong ability they might just start using it all on you.There could be alternate reactions when they reach the fear threshold. While they will usually flee, some might hide from you (possibly attacking again later or spying on you) or they might surrender. If they surrender, you can choose to either kill them or spare their life. If you spare their life, you can then either take the loot they would have had anyway or you can send them out to tell others what you did. This can change your reputation, if the game has a reputation mechanic. If you already have a reputation for being ruthless and leaving no survivors, that probably increases the chance that they flee instead of surrender. Could even send those who surrender out on a mission for you, though that definitely depends on the kind of game you're making. Also, could be funny if low constitution/vitality enemies have a chance of dying from heart attack when they reach the fear threshold.There could be a spell of some kind that lets you detect enemy fear. Maybe their heart beats faster the more terror they have, maybe they glow red or orange, or maybe it's just a number next to them. If this is a game where you have allies, the fear mechanic could work on them too. You can have bravery spells that remove terror (can be used on enemies too, to ensure they can't flee if you have trouble catching up).Alcohol can decrease terror, both of your enemies and your allies.Fear meter can also apply outside of combat. Merchants will have a lower "social" fear meter (Usually \~50), which is meant to only rely on your passive terror increase from armor and what-not. As you get closer to the fear threshold, prices get higher, but once you hit that threshold the prices go down by a lot. So you may want to try and look less intimidating when you head to the market, but if you can pull it off you can reap some good rewards. Doing things that are more.. *active* ways of inciting terror, like killing nearby people and summoning giant nightmare demons, will just cause them to not sell to you at all and might get the guards called on you.That's about it. I think this is a really interesting mechanic and I never do see many mechanics posted here, so I figured I'd go for it. It's inspired by a somewhat similar system in some Assassin's Creed games, but I'm not sure exactly how that one works.
 
Indie horror, thieves decide to hit a bank that is rumoured to have little to no security overnight 
This one comes with lore, so get your popcorn ready.In 1893, a bank was opened in a city. In 1895, a man named Randy McClain robbed this bank with his fiancé Edith. Originally, the plan was to have Edith distract the men inside while Randy snuck through the door to set up his dynamite on the vault door. Unfortunately for them, a local gang of outlaws caught wind of their robbery and were on their way to the scene.Randy lit the charge and walked back into the room. The explosion knocked the unsuspecting men over. He took out his gun and aimed it at them to ensure they wouldn’t fight back while Edith tied them up.More dynamite was set, and a giant hole is blown through the side of the building for a quick escape. By this time, the gang had arrived and surrounded Edith. Their leader grabbed her and lifted his gun to her head. He threatened to shoot unless Randy gave up the money. Edith begged for her life, she pleaded for Randy to hand over his bag, but he turned away. Randy scurried through the front entrance where his horse was waiting, and with that, Edith was shot and killed.Before the gang could pursue him, the lawmen arrived and were quick to neutralise anybody attempting to leave the scene. The sheriff noticed the bag of money held by Randy as he rode past. He readied his gun, and shot him twice in the back. The gang escaped, and the stolen money was returned to the bank.Randy and Edith had a baby together a few months prior to the robbery. Her name was Jodie. Due to her parent’s death, Jodie’s grandmother took care of her until she passed away of natural causes. By age 13, Jodie was alone. She would eventually join a gang of outlaws and become a criminal.In 2003, 108 years after the bank robbery, the city has become much larger. The land where the bank once stood is now occupied by a new bank, a slightly larger building with a bigger vault.You play as Joshua McClain, Randy’s great great grandson. Your family has a history in crime, and you’ve never cared to investigate further than that. Joshua’s record is fairly bare. Petty thievery and trespassing, but nothing major. He’s looking to hit a bigger score. Getting a crew together in a town like this isn’t a particularly difficult task, but finding a score worth taking is.One of the thugs he wrangled up mentioned a bank that they’ve been scoping over the last few weeks. According to him, every guard is gone by 10 and there aren’t any working security cameras.The crew all agrees that this bank is their best shot at a decent payday. Without guards or cameras, it’s as simple as it sounds. Or is it?So that’s the story. If you couldn’t tell, the game would be an indie horror where you and a small group of thugs attempt to break into and rob a bank that’s haunted by Edith, a woman who was betrayed by your great great grandfather during a robbery that went south, and subsequently murdered. In terms of mechanics, you’d begin by finding a way into the building. Once you’re in, you have to break into the vault. This is a spooky building at night, so you’ll already be creeped out by the ambience. However, once you’re in the vault, Edith recognises you. This is the equivalent of picking up the first page in Slender (Edith will now stalk you). While looting the vault, you and your crew realise you’re trapped inside. Your goal is to escape the vault - which appears to be dimensionally transcendental - with *or without* them. Due to the constantly shifting vaults and pathways, you’ll struggle to find your way out. With any luck, you’ll survive Edith’s attacks and escape the bank. Don’t take too long though, because once the sun’s up the bank will open and you’ll be caught red handed. Hey, at least prison isn’t haunted.
 
Infinite magazine size which effects damage and reload time 
This is a mechanic for a non-serious FPS game. You can shoot as many bullets without reloading as you like, but the catch is that damage goes down slightly over time (which insentivises reloading) and the longer you shoot for, the longer the reload takes. This would obviously need some tweaking but that's the basic idea.
 
A game where you can take your eye out and throw it. Wherever it goes, that's where the game camera goes. 
You play as a Mike Wazowski-type creature with a giant eye, which can be removed and thrown. The eye is still attached to the optic nerve, of course, so it eventually springs back into the eye socket. But when it is away from the player, the camera follows.   This could lead to some interesting puzzles involving camera perspective. Say you encounter two pathways, one with an incredibly strong enemy who can instantly kill you in one shot, and one with a treasure chest. You need to use your removable eye to determine the safest path. You could also find a way to trap the eye in a certain area while the player goes and does something else. You need to be careful though, because the eye can be separated from the optic nerve if it is hit, in which case you need to wander around in the dark to recover it. Once recovered, you can see normally. Maybe you even collect eyes to get better/clearer vision.   You can also you use the optic eye for as a grappling hook for platforming, maybe by swinging it on a certain type of branch.
 
MMORPG where instead leveling stats, you change physic size 
Very old idea of mine that came from my early vanilla WoW days - when gankers made me hated starting out - what if the high level players can't revisit low level areas?From there came the idea of an MMORPG where you grow in size as you 'level' up, where you're able to reach places you couldn't when small, but also unable to get into smaller places, and small players could even climb on you to gain access to places that you can't get into but they can't reach.There's a natural element of larger players being 'tanks', but with different sizes come the opportunity of tanks at different sizes - I think if the size mechanic is adapted to have varieties, it could be quite cool.In my own concept of this game, the world would be set on tectonic plates that move so that the world changes over time, but that concept can be a game concept in itself.
 
A language learning game in which you attent a language school in a foreign country 
Main idea is that you travel to a foreign country, go to a language school there to learn the language and the game is multiplayer (kind of mmo) so you are there with many other people who have the same goal of wanting to learn the language. That is the general core gameplay, just following kanguage lessons and doing tests, just like a real foreign language school but inside of a game.Does this sound fun, boring, dull, interesting, ...?
 
A war table game where you don't control armies but their loyalty 
Not sure if this type of game exist already but i always wanted to play as a strategist who sits at the war table in the capital city, moving piece figures on order of who and where to fight, but not directly fighting in the game. Essentially the mechanics would be listed as this.&#x200B;You control a war table with the maps terrain to direct your commanders&#x200B;Each commander of your army controls a division of soldiers. They all have different traits, soldiers and personalities.&#x200B;you can order your commanders to do certain task, such as defending a village, pillaging it, attacking nearby armies, burning down crop fields, recruiting peasants, ect. You only can assign one task to each commander and most tasks takes multiple turns to accomplish.&#x200B;Your commanders do not need to follow your orders if their loyalty bar is too low. If you fail a loyalty check, they will choose their own task, regardless of the consequences. If it's low enough, they can even commit treason. Other things commanders can possibly do is break diplomacy deals, start a war, retire.&#x200B;You constantly stay in touch with your commanders everyday so they may voice their opinion of a matter or help to solve a grudge or issue. &#x200B;you can talk alliances, trades, embargo, wars with other kingdoms&#x200B;random weather and luck based events on specific terrain pieces of the war table&#x200B;The commanders loyalty bar is affected by fortunate/unfortunate events, weather, terrain control, resources monopolies, pillaging/protecting villages, starting wars or alliances, ignoring/solving his voiced opinions and complaints and specific traits they may have.&#x200B;End game would ultimately be full unification, from diplomacy or force and your ruler being anointed as supreme emperor. &#x200B;It's a little unpolished of an idea, but i think it has some value to it. Just the idea of making long tough war strategies, knowingly that the choices you make will either make a commander become a trustworthy follower or backstabber really sound interesting to me. The best way i can describe this game is as if Civilization 5, Reigns and Football Manager 2018 had a baby lol. Any thoughts? and what would you change/add/get rid of?
 
Zombie horde simulator/rpg 
This game totally needs to be made. You have levels you have to conquer. Towns or whatever. You literally start with one basic zombie in one household or whatever. You attack and spread and gradually expand your horde. You gain some kind of xp to upgrade mutations to strengthen your horde. I was thinking a top down view. Levels would be towns and places. Boss levels army camps or large blockades. It would kinda run like an RTS but the horde would have some basic aggressive Ai so your more guiding the horde rather than taking full tactical control. As you progress in a level the area's you conquer have a zombie apocalypse visual que. Such as everything in chaos broken and burning. Just to hint there's no survivors left there. When breaking into buildings ands homes it would kinda look like xcon. Where you could see inside. Survivors can over time barricade themselves in a building and fire upon your horde and it would take time to get to them. All wile losing zombies! The police would attack the horde. Army etc so you do have enemies to deal with. There so much could be done with this idea.
 
Soaked- A neighborhood water gun and balloon battle royale with clothes drying mechanics and more 
Setting: A peaceful Midwest USA suburban neighborhood during a particularly warm Mid-1990’s summer day.Concept: Everybody in the neighborhood is participating in this massive water fight. Gimmick: Your saturation meter is your health bar. You will slowly dry off again over time. Remaining in direct sunlight (and direct visibility) will dry you off faster. Finding a dry towel and using it (like a first aid kit) will dry you off even more. There are also stationary fans that will dry you off very quickly. If your saturation meter hits 100%, you’re out of the game.You also have stamina- you will get tired and exhausted, so you’ll need to grab a Squeeze-It juice bottle to refresh yourself and maybe a freshly cooked hotdog from near the grill.Map confinement: As the game goes on, the lawn sprinkler systems starting at the outer perimeter begin to turn on, forcing you toward the center and reducing the size of the playable area.Weapons: You have your basic and rudimentary single pump water pistol that delivers one small squirt per trigger pull. Not very effective but better than nothing. Then you have the charge-up power soaker- a two handed water gun with an air tank that you pump up which allows you to fire continuously until the air pressure runs out. There are an array of these, some have larger water reservoirs, some require less pumps to charge, some have bigger streams but run out of air and water quickly, some fire thinner streams but last longer. There are water balloons as well, you can carry a few in your pouch. These are sufficient for a pretty good soaking with a direct hit, but also cause, ahem, “splash damage” if you only hit near your target.There are also mounted guns- I mean, garden hoses that you can use for an unlimited amount of time, but you won’t be able to travel far with them. You will need to refill your water weapons as they run out of water. For this, you need to visit a water source such as a garden hose, water bucket, or unground pool. The pool is the fastest way but it comes with an added danger- if another player sees you kneeling down to fill your weapon, they can run up and shove you into the water. In a pinch, you can also transfer water from one weapon to another- though you are likely to spill a small percentage of water in the process.The match ends when there is one player left with less than 100% saturation, or when the street lights come on and all remaining players are called home by their moms- in which case the driest player wins.
 
The Voyager 
i dunno if i'm using the right flair, if i'm not please tell me.i had this idea while working on a titanic assignment and i would make it but i have no game making experience whatsoever-The Voyager is a 2d game where you must escape a massive sinking ship within 4 hours. (or maybe 2 hours, with a smaller map.)you play as a random worker, starting at the very bottom of the ship...casually doing work when BAM! the ship hits something, and now you must escape, before it's too late!the game would probably be similar to a metroidvania, since you collect tools and other items in order to aid in your escape.as the game progresses, more rooms flood, and the ship tilts, making it harder to escape.2 hours and a smaller map is the most realistic option tbh.that's all i really have right now, might come up with more ideas later.
 
A Visual Novel That Breaks The 4th Wall In A Different Way 
You follow the main character but instead of him being your usual self insert character he's actually a legit main character. You actually don't get to control him but the story is still narrated by him. Instead, the choices you make are for the other characters in crucial moments.Now, here's the catch. The main character actually know's that he's in a visual novel and will try to manipulate you with his inner dialogue to get you to choose the options for the other characters that he wants. Of course, you won't know that until after some time, or after you choose enough of the options that negatively affect him.Even though he knows he's in a video game he doesn't see the other's characters as less, just unaware. His ultimate goal is elongating the visual novel as far as possible by not getting any bad or good endings so that he and the others can exist for longer. That's why he wants you to choose the options that don't make characters fall in love with him or hate him so much that he gets a bad end. In his eyes he considers you a god.For the ultimate game changer, there's a character that can modify the game but that you can still control (though she gains sentience eventually as well) and you can do crazy stuff. From erasing characters from existance, to changing their personalities. You can actually even remove the awareness from the main character.With these options you can get a variety of endings. If you decide to antagonize him by choosing options that don't keep him and the other characters as friends he will talk his way out of it and into the friend path again, though it won't be the same as if you did what he wanted. Even though, he won't be able to talk his way out of everything, getting him a variety of bad endings by different causes. If you follow everything he wants you to do eventually the world starts to break and you will have to restart the game from the beginning, but the protagonist will remember. From there the ultimate ending is him and the other characters gaining awareness as well and them deciding that's better to not exist anymore. The game then ends and you can replay the game again but without the protagonist being aware.You would be able to really fuck shit up with the character that can change the game, and you could technically get the ultimate ending from before by just removing the awareness of the protagonist and restarting the game. Using her you could also get an another ending in which you remove sentience from the protagonist but instead give sentience to her. She then decides to place that world in the internet so that no one dissapears, holding the burden of her being the only sentient one.I think the setting would be in a slightly futuristic Japan. The only character whose personality matters is the protagonists. He should be cunning and confident, but can obviously add other things to make him interesting.
 
A Medieval version of Doom 
Feel free to use this idea:  This would be a Medieval 1st person shooter.  The mechanics should be very similar to Doom.Story: The game is set close to the end of the second Crusade in 1149.  The Church knew that it was going badly.  A desperate and angry bishop attempted to make a deal with demons to secure victory, and opened up a portal to Hell. The demons promised to unleash their fury on the Church’s Muslim enemies.  This was technically true, but in their conversations with the bishop, they left out the part about killing everyone else on Earth too.  As soon as the portal opened, demons poured out and started slaughtering everyone. The dead were transformed into zombies, and numerous cities became havens for undead and demons.The protagonist:  You play the role of a city guard trained in the crossbow. You just completed your basic training, and are essentially some nobody that gets caught in the middle of this. You live in one of the villages that was slaughtered and reanimated.  Starting the game surrounded by your neighbors that are now undead monsters trying to kill you, you must fight to survive.  It’s up to you to fight your way through the Hellspawn horde, gradually figure out what happened, and defeat the demon lord Orcus and destroy the portal.Part 1: The Necropolis.  The first part of the game takes place above ground.  You must venture through numerous stages. Each stage is a village or city that has been destroyed and corrupted. You primarily fight with zombies and weaker demons.Part 2:  The Catacombs.  This part of the game is underground. The enemies are substantially harder.  Here, you battle liches, skeletal knights, and more powerful demons. At the end of Part 2, you must battle the bishop, who is now fully corrupted and loyal to the Devil.  From there, you take the portal to Abaddon.Part 3: Abaddon.  This is the region of Hell where the demon lord Orcus resides.  His intention is to build an undead army to conquer the Earth.  From here on, the enemies are difficult.  Once Orcus is defeated, you must destroy the portal and escape. Weapon: Your weapon would be a crossbow.  This would not change throughout the game. Crossbows fire bolts, and different types of bolts would have different effects. You’d start with standard bolts, but you’d also find rapid-fire bolts, explosive bolts, poisoned bolts, fire and ice bolts, holy bolts, etc.  Ammo would be found throughout the game much like in Doom.  When you run out of ammo, you have a dagger.Maneuverability: The game allows 3-D motion.  A computer mouse should be used to aim, and the arrow keys are for moving in different directions.  For game systems with controllers, one stick should be for aiming and one for moving.  You can also jump, crouch, and run (which depletes stamina).Health: 100% is full health, and you die when your health reaches 0%. If you die, then you must begin at the beginning of that stage.  Healing potions can be found throughout the game, which recover health.Armor:  You start with your clothes.  Later in the game, you can find leather armor, which reduces damage by 10%. Further in the game, you find copper armor, which reduces damage by 20%, and then iron armor (30%) and divine armor (40%). You’ll need those armor improvements, since enemies get harder and inflict more damage as the game progresses.
 
Stop the assassin 
After reading this, please put some other ideas for this game in the comments, if you want!You are an good agent that is sent to places where an assassination will occur. You know who will be assassinated, but not who will do it. There will be a lot of people in these locations, and you have to find the assassin by analyzing strange behavior in them. You must find a way to intercept the assassination and keep the target alive. Killing the assassin is allowed, but only under certain circumstances. You also don't have to kill them.You win if:1. The assassin is killed without anyone knowing it was a murder/ away from everyone without them finding out.2. The person is stealthily knocked out and captured; this is a good way to get info.3. Another way is found to not have the assassination take place.You lose if:1. Innocent Civilians see you knock out or kill the assassin.2. Any innocent civilians are harmed. You're a good guy, you don't do that.3. The target of the assassination is killed.There could also be some sort of online multiplayer.This game is meant to test people's creativity. It seems like a fairly good idea!
 
A Turn-based Rpg where your attacks are origami objects (E.g Shuriken, sword). 
This is just the base idea of my concept, I haven't really planned out any other key things for it yet.Basically you craft your attacks through origami mid-battle by playing a sort of folding minigame (like pressing a button at the right time or holding down a button until you have to let go, similar to the attacks in Paper Mario).Aesthetically, you could also have your *mana* bar actually be pieces of paper used up for your origami attacks. Furthermore you could (*POSSIBLY*) have most of the world be made out of origami.As you can tell I was really inspired by Paper Mario the Origami King when writing this.Hope someone found reading this poorly thought-out concept amusing.
 
A "city building"-like game where you rebuild the failing internal systems of a person in poor health, and make them mega healthy 
You would control upgrades through the brain (such as diet habits, exercise habits, mindset etc.) but you'd have to hit certain requirements beforehand. You would distribute muscle and hormone "buildings" that you think would meet your brain goals or unlock things.External events like tornados and earthquakes would come in the form of life events (like breakups or sickness) which you would need to mitigate.
 
Just put 10000 peoples mouse cursors on the same screen and see what patterns form together 
This is something I'm trying to figure out how to do in  [https://www.reddit.com/r/mouseswarm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mouseswarm/)  but today's tech seems to fall short of it
 
Steampunk hacking simulator 
You're an elite hacker in a goofy steampunk world.  The "computers" are powered by mice running through mazes, water being poured from one jar to another, ropes that "network" to other computers when you pull on them, displays powered by scribbling styluses, etc.You have to hack into various other systems in strange ways (drug the mice, set the ropes on fire (disabling the firewall, of course), cranking the computer gears backwards (to recreate the last user's input), that kind of thing.
 
A dating sim without anyone to date... so you feel forever alone. (hear me out, though) 
So this is a satirical dating sim in which any girls you try to confess to will immediately and brutally shoot you down.### The unique dialogue system.This game features a "derail" dialogue system in which you can steer the game's scripted conversations. After every line of dialogue, you can choose to continue the current conversation route if you like, or you can instead try to change the subject and move to a different conversation route if you don't like where the current one is going. In either case, your character talks just as much as the other person so that it feels like an actual conversation rather than NPCs spewing lines at you. Conversations either end naturally or when you both run out of things to talk about.Why is it like this? Because these girls suuuuuuuuck. They're designed to be cute but extremely one-dimensional. Your conversations with them are meant to make you want to end them early.**All** the girls in this game will reject you. You can try to reload your latest save to do things differently all you want, but no matter what you try, they will turn you down in the most heinous ways possible. The game keeps track of how often you reload and will subtly alter your character to look shlubbier the more you do it. These and other methods are used to dissuade the player from attempting confessions.### There's one saving grace, though:There's one NPC that is written to be genuine, intriguing and three-dimensional... but she's the game's non-courtable shopkeeper NPC. You can't date or even confess to her. Still, her witty dialogue, expressive nature and interesting personal stories are enough to keep you coming back to talk to her even when you don't have anything to buy. At the start she is simply cordial, but as you continue to speak with each other she starts opening up more. Even your character starts revealing things he never does to the other girls.In the end, if you continue this route, you'll get the ability to confess to her as well.
 
A warioware-like parody game of mobile game advertisements. 
 
A player that can control lightbulbs, flashlights, lamps, TV screens, and anything that uses light to investigate a blackout in the depths of an abandoned city. 
The player has the ability to control light waves from a phone to a light on the ceiling. While he explores, the player can hold lightbulbs and place them on the ground to light up the dark areas and always carries a flashlight.Any object that can hold his light energy can keep holding the players light no matter if its plugged in a wall or not. The player goes into a slow motion view that shows any object that can hold his light and can choose items to shoot light into within the players visual range. (Perhaps the player needs to "charge" by gathering light energy from the sun or other places.)Theres something that feeds on light energy within the city and will try to destroy light sources so the player has to hide himself in certain areas.I'm thinking that when you go deep enough below the city (to where its pitch-black) theres shadow soldiers that patrol the area protecting the shadow god that feeds on light waves. If you shine a light on them, they will feed on the light and eat up the light waves until the object stops working and takes all of your light energy from your body. (Resulting in your death) they also can "steal" light and take it to the shadow god as an offering. Just thought of this idea, I'm sure theres a game like it but can't find it.
 
A 2D platforming game without gravity. 
All hell breaks loose when someone accidentally destroys the artificial gravity pump in your space superstation.The game starts off as a goofy platformer except there is no "up" so to speak. The world and map rotates freely around the player. At first you're fairly limited: you could only grab onto and jump off of ladders, handholds and ropes. Later you'll get magnet boots to stick to metal surfaces and fire extinguishers to propel yourself for limited bursts.By the end, you'll be equipped to the gills and able to expertly zip around the labyrinthian superstation.****Again, it starts off pretty goofy. The superstation is mostly run by ineffective robots that can't handle zero gravity. The Claptrap-like robots will need your rescuing. Things take a turn for the sinister when some of them begin to malfunction and act hostile (like the AI in Portal's turrets) and you find evidence that the gravity pump failure wasn't an accident. You suspect one of the other human crewmembers might be a saboteur.Although some robots become hostile, it's not really for *combat.* They're more like hazards in the same way turrets are in Portal. The game is a exploration platformer through and through. It's like if Super Metroid was set in a space station full of dopey NPCs and the biggest challenge was just getting around.
 
Pet Simulator with a Twist 
In this one, YOU'RE the pet, and you have to figure out what it is your dumbass owner wants of you.&#x200B;You start out hearing "mwah mwah mwah" like Charlie Brown's teachers.  One of the first things is, "mwah!" \*You feel a hand on your butt, pressing it down to the floor".  "MWAH!"  \*You feel a hand on your butt, pressing it down to the floor"  "Mwah!" (the owner stands and waits).  What do you do, dog?  If you get it right, and "sit", that "mwah" now gets translated.And of course, it just gets harder from there.  Have fun figuring out the whole potty thing.&#x200B;Protip for real pet owners - always play show and tell or do and tell with your pets, so they learn the meaning of the words.  Yes, they can do it, and my cat is learning to use pictograms.&#x200B;
 
How important is the opening info dump in an RPG? 
Hopefully this is the correct Reddit forum to ask this, but when introducing a game world far different from our own, how important do you think it is that there is some form of exposition setting up how it works? I'm thinking of something like Pokemon, where you get a short spiel about "This is the world of Pokemon! Monsters who live besides us and battle, where you will become a trainer, blah blah blah."&#x200B;Icewind Dale, and many RPGs have some five minute cutscene setting the world up and who the major players are, yet a game like Morrowind just dumps you into the action. You woke up on a boat, now get lost and see what happens. No setting up of magic or how the politics of the place works, you just figure that out on your own.&#x200B;Perhaps the difference is how much the PC should already know? Have they suffered amnesia and know nothing about their own universe, or are they some dimensional traveler it's all new to?&#x200B;Suppose you start an RPG where every NPC has three heads, it must be assumed this is normal for their world, so how wold the player learn why this is so? Should there be an opening cut scene explaining it, or a book hidden away somewhere explaining what's going on?&#x200B;I'm wondering if anyone has any good ideas on how to naturally introduce a bizarre concept to the player?
 
The Thing (Based off the movie) 
With the recent rise in popularity of Among Us, I’m gonna give my idea for a game I’ve been thinking about for years. The game is multiplayer only, and supports anywhere from 6-12 players depending on game mode. The Game is third person, and players take control of one of the 12 researchers featured in The Thing (1982). Setting: In an Arctic Lab, isolated from all outside contact, with the exception of radio communication. Plot of each match: The radio has been sabotaged, and the humans must try and find the necessary pieces, parts, or tools to repair it. Each match is entirely random in its spawning of the pieces parts and tools necessary to repair the radio. Humans can also escape via helicopter under certain circumstances. Once all parts and tools are collected the humans must repair the radio. This takes 30 seconds for a normal human, and 15 for the radio specialist. Factions: Humans, aliens, reinforcements. Humans: Human’s primary goal is to repair the radio and get out of the research lab alive, but can also win by killing all aliens. Each human have different tasks they must do to get supplies to repair the radio. All humans who are killed and not assimilated spectate the match, similar to Among Us. They spawn in as reinforcements once the radio is fixed and used. Humans’ bodies can be looted to recover any keys, parts or weapons they were carrying, but can only be looted by humans. (Special human classes): 1) Enforcer: One player spawns with a revolver that is concealed until drawn. All other players are oblivious as to who has the gun, and only the player who gets it will know. It has 6 rounds, and takes 3 body shots to kill a human, and 1 headshot to kill a human. The revolver can stagger the alien, but the alien cannot be killed via the revolver, only stunned.2) Radio specialist: This player can repair the radio in half the time a normal human can, and is essential to the human team. Only select humans will be notified of who the radio specialist is so that the alien does not kill him immediately. 3) Head Scientist: The head scientist is known to all players, regardless of faction, and has authority over the humans. He can call 2 more meetings/blood tests  than a regular player, and has slightly more health.4) Janitor: This player spawns with a key that can unlock the janitor’s closet, which contains a part necessary to repair the radio in each match, a blow torch with 1 can of propane, and a random key to a special room in the lab. 5) Pilot: This character is very important to keep alive, and is known to all humans but not to aliens. This character has the keys to the helicopter, but is only able to use the helicopter as a last-ditch effort to escape. Up to 3 other humans can escape with the pilot at the end of the match under the right circumstances. 1) The pilot must be alive 2) All parts to fix the radio have not been found 3) The majority of players are on the alien team. Aliens will still win the round when this happens but it makes it possible for some humans to finish the game alive. Aliens: One player spawns as an Alien who must kill and assimilate all other players to win. Humans killed by the alien can be assimilated and join the alien team. Assimilated humans drop all of their items and cannot pick them up, acting as a way to tell someone has been assimilated. Aliens have 10 seconds after killing someone to begin assimilating them, which takes 4 seconds for the original (or upgraded) alien, and 8 seconds for an assimilated alien. The alien has a kill cool down similar to the imposter in Among Us, to keep it from killing everyone very quickly. Once every 5-7minutes, the original alien player can morph into a large and lethal mutation that kills humans very quickly, but the players killed using this mode cannot be assimilated. Humans assimilated by the alien are still able to kill people, but have a longer cooldown and assimilate very slowly. Once an assimilated player assimilates another player, it has all the perks of the original alien, and can morph into the deadly but noticeable mutation. The original alien can “vent” to different rooms throughout the lab to get to different locations quickly. The alien can only vent to rooms that are unlocked to prevent imbalance. Aliens can use weapons such as guns and flamethrowers to keep their cover, but cannot hold items such as parts and health equipment. Aliens also don’t regenerate health. Aliens cannot be killed by bullets, but are stunned by them, with 3 shots from the revolver stunning them, and one shot from the shotgun stunning them. Aliens are stunned for 3-5 seconds depending on the gun. Aliens are also stunned and heavily damaged by explosives such as grenades and pipe bombs. The way to kill aliens is through fire, either by making a Molotov cocktail with materials scavenged from around the lab, a blow torch, or a flamethrower. It takes 2 molotovs to kill an alien, 10 seconds of blow torch fire, and 5 seconds of flamethrower fire. Reinforcements: All human players not assimilated and aliens killed spawn in as reinforcements once the radio has been used. Reinforcements all have the same gear, including flamethrowers, shotguns, and grenades. They also have skeleton keys and can open every door in the lab. They have armor and have much more health than regular humans. Their job is to kill all aliens and rescue the remaining humans. Items: 1) Keys (are marked for use). Unlock doors/enable access to helicopter. Janitor key, armory key, helicopter key, room keys, etc)2) random scavenged supplies (bottles, rags, alcohol, gunpowder, pipes, etc.) 3) medical supplies (rags, sterile bandages, medkit, pain medicine, and adrenaline shots). Rags act as bandages but do not give as much health, and are random in the amount of health given (anywhere from 3-14 health can be given). Bandages restore 15 health but cannot heal to full (similar to fortnite). Medkit completely heals health. Pain medicine gradually gives health back for a period of 2 minutes, and will keep the health stable for another 2 minutes, but will gradually return back to the health you had before taking them. Adrenaline shots increase speed, and give artificial hp(similar to scp: sl), as well as reducing incoming damage. Weapons: 1) Revolver: One shot to the head, 3 to the body on humans. 3 shots to stagger aliens. Spawns with 6 rounds. 2) Shotgun: One shot anywhere to the body at close/medium range on humans, and one shot to stagger the alien. 3 rounds in chamber (4 rounds in reserve for reinforcements). One shotgun is located in the armory. 3) Blow torch: Can be fired for 30 seconds, but does low/moderate damage to both aliens and humans. Takes 10 seconds to kill aliens, and 15 for humans. Only one blow torch spawns per match, and it’s in the Janitors closet every time. 5) Flamethrower: Only 2 spawn in armory each match, and one member of the reinforcements team has one. Can be fired for 10 seconds, and does extremely high damage. Can be used to paint areas in fire, or to cause direct damage. Shooting players with the flamethrower will catch them on fire, causing a burning DOT effect. Damage varies depending on whether the player is a human or alien. (Humans are more resistant to fire). Takes 5 seconds of sustained fire to kill an alien, and 7 for humans. 6) Molotovs: Inflict an AOE DOT effect and acts exactly like a flamethrower is direct impacted on a player or alien. 7) Flame-Grenades: Only spawn on reinforcements, and are extremely powerful grenades that can 1-shot an alien if close enough. Each reinforcement troop that doesn’t have a flamethrower will get 1 grenade. This grenade can kill anything instantly within 5 feet and set everything in fire in an 8 feet area8) Pipe-Bombs: Explosive device made by scavenging materials around the lab. (Requires pipe, gunpowder, and random metal parts). Does high damage within 3 feet and damage drips off quickly, barely damaging players at 5 feet. Stuns the alien as if they got hit with a grenade. 9) Frag-Grenade: Spawns only on reinforcements, and does extremely high damage in a 10 foot radius. Anywhere further than 10 feet does not get damaged at all. Stuns aliens for 5 seconds, and instantly kills humans within 5 feet. Gameplay: All players spawn in the center of the lab and have objectives spread throughout the entire lab, forcing players to split up to complete them. Meetings: Can be called by any player (human or alien) to relay information. Brings all players back to spawn. Has a 20 second cooldown before being called again. Blood test: A meeting but all the player’s blood will be tested. THIS KIND OF MEETING CAN ONLY BE CALLED IF A PLAYER HAS A FLAMETHROWER OR BLOW TORCH. All players can see and are aware of who’s blood is being tested. Each person’s blood is tested randomly and their name and player model is shown while being tested. Aliens can attack during blood tests, but only if they have reached an upgraded level, as they must have their “ultimate” charged and ready. Once a player is discovered to be an alien, the game will return to regular gameplay and any players with weapons are tasked with killing the alien. Once that is done the test will end and must be called again by another player. Also has a 20 second cooldown before being called again. Armory: A key to the armory will spawn in a random room throughout the lab which can be accessed without another key. Aliens cannot pick up the armory key to make sure that humans have a fighting chance. Radio: All human players are notified if the radio is fixed and when reinforcements come. Blood bags: A fridge containing blood bags of all the players’ blood is located in a random, locked room in the lab. Humans can test this blood if they have a blow torch or flamethrower, and determine which player was/is the original alien. Aliens can sabotage the blood, keeping themselves and their allies hidden. Sabotaging takes 3 seconds and it has a visible animation of all the blood spilling out of the fridge. Special conditions: 1) If there are no completely dead players and the radio is fixed, humans win immediately. 2) If there are only 2 humans left alive, and are outnumbered by the aliens, the aliens win immediately. Additional info:1) If a human kills multiple humans in a round they become more vulnerable to prevent trolling and encourage thoughtful play. 2) The lab is the same every time, but item locations are randomized. 3) Aliens can still win after the radio has been used if they kill all reinforcements and humans. Thank you for reading! And if anyone wants to make this an actual game PLEASS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO IT. Also, feel free to tell me any criticism or confusion you have so I can make changes.
 
A Pokémon game where you play as the Pokémon, but the combat is more akin to an Action RPG. 
Obviously there is the Mystery Dungeon series, where you play as the Pokemon. I want a game similar to that, but with different combat. I want the combat to be similar to Final Fantasy XV or Final Fantasy VII Remake. It would be amazing to see a character like Pikachu use flashy and over the top moves, similar to Noctis or Cloud in their respective games (Pikachu could even move extremely fast, leaving a streak of lightning, to seemingly teleport, similar to Noctis' own warp ability).Of course, their wouldn't be as many playable Pokemon as there are in the Mystery Dungeon series. It would take a long time to develop many different fighting styles for so many characters, so it would likely have to be nailed down to about 3 or 4 characters (basing this completely on Final Fantasy VII Remake combat, with Cloud, Barret, Aerith, and Tifa being the playable characters in there). I'm not sure exactly which Pokemon would be playable, as their are so many, but it would be great if the roster had Pokemone from different generations. So obviously Pikachu would be the Gen 1 representation, but I do not know who could represent the rest. And I would rather not all of them be starter Pokemon. It would probably be good to have the 4 Pokemon be a certain type of fighter (i.e. Close Range, Long Range, Support, and Tank).
 
A game like the modern Hitman games, except with "silent drop-in multiplayer" (you aren't told how many players are sharing your world or who they are) and any player can get bonus scores for making another player get caught. 
It's a stealth game in levels full of NPCs and you start each single-player mission with a randomized character appearance. **It's not an assassination game;** rather, your story mission objectives range from things like stealing documents and finding a target's password, to planting bugs in a room and reverse-pickpocketing to plant evidence on an NPC. You still have some non-lethal combat options which are mostly used to steal disguises.The twist is that you can be dropped into a level that already has other players hidden in it going about their own story missions.####You can't assassinate each other.Instead, if you spot some NPC acting like a human *you can report them.* You see, a main feature of this game is the ability to mislead guards (and other NPCs) by walking up to them and reporting suspicious activity. You get a prompt to give them a description and/or location, which leads them investigate or call it in (which in turn might clear a path for you if they leave). If your shenanigans lead to them getting caught, you get a sweet bonus. You might even disguise yourself as a guard NPC to scare them into trouble if you're confident they won't realize you're just another player.There are more ways to mess with other players, such as throwing something loud near them, locking doors on them or planting a tracking device in their pocket (inventory), to name a few examples. Finding other players is a little rare (especially since they tend to be blending in as best they can), but it's just common enough that you're always on edge.
 
An RPG Game that forces you into encounters where you're severely underlevelled, and have to gain the upper hand through mechanics and cheese strats 
Just thought that since a lot of games are level dependent, why not a game where you're never the right level.The story could be like "the gods of the world despise your existence, and throw you in exceedingly impossible missions in an attempt to kill you" or something like that. Then with your ingenuity and situational awareness, you win the fight anyway
 
A bullet hell game where you have to touch every bullet 
I feel like it could be an interesting role swap. Since bullet hells do have a lot of bullets, it would still be somewhat challenging.
 
How to make a bullet hell game stand out? 
Taking a break from my main project for a side project. It's basically just a bullet hell. I have a few ideas to make it interesting/standout but these are mostly graphical ideas. I feel like the standard bullet hell has been done to death but I'm having troubles coming up with twists or additional ideas to make it stand out or interesting. Any ideas? I'm mostly just brain storming at the moment, not looking for anything too specific just something to get the creative ideas flowing
 
Earthbending your way through my tile based roguelike. 
Hi guys, I'm an indie dev and I need your creative help!What I'm proposing is a narrative roguelike where two characters battle creatures on a transformable tilemap. Each character has a distinct fighting style: the first one is a classic fighter with weapons and special abilities/attacks. The second is capable of raising the ground, tearing the tilemap appart and moving the tiles in more defensive ways to avoid taking damage.The movement is similar to what you would see in crypt of the necrodancer but without the rythm. The enemies in this game will typically just come up to you and deal damage, but can also use projectiles and some of them will also possess this earthbending skill.What I'm looking for are spell ideas to make the concept of earthbending tiles more interesting. (And roguelike attack paterns too while I'm at it.)Thank you.
 
An advice for ppl giving ideas 
Hey, I'm a beginner at developing, still learning, and I wanna say that if you just have a tiny idea, like a simple game mechanic, don't always try to develop a lore or just doing a huge story about it, it's fine, small and simple game mechanic ideas are as valuable as full "game ideas". It may even be better to me. Thank you for reading me, keep developing and giving ideas people !
 
RTS style game but the player only controls a single builder/worker unit 
and that’s as far as that idea goes. I like the concept but can’t get any further than that. How would you make a game fun by taking control of a single builder/worker/gatherer unit and the rest of the world is done by the computer? should the player be able to choose where to build things or should that also be decided by the game as you are only a peasant after all? should the player’s only strategy be in deciding in what order to build, gather resources or assist the combat units in some other way? trying to flesh out my idea so that I can potentially create a game out of itEDIT: Thanks for all of the ideas!Here is a first gameplay video: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/hh1sic/i_decided_to_start_working_on_my_idea_that_i/
 
Horror game where you play for possesed character 
So the idea is simple, it is horror game but there is no villain coming after you, instead you slowly become villain, lose control over your body and kill other people. Your goal is to break it before you loose control completly. As you progress in the game, you controls come more more and more unrelyable and there would be more moments of sudden quirks when you unvoluntarily kill someone. Sometimes your victims may try to fight back and at the end of the game, your friends cant know if you already totaly lost control or not and will try to fight you. You would have halucinations, see strange things, see different face in mirror or hear voices. Sometimes in dialogue with characters, you choose to say something but your characters say something else. At the beggining, it would start as innocent, you may sometimes do some nonsense that you could adress to clumsiness but after some time, you will find, that something is not in order.
 
A vr libarary with all of Wikipedia. It would be like vr chat but with knowledge! 
 
A game where you assassinate the assasins 
You are hired by a mob boss to kill specific people. You are chosen because you are capable and have the skills. Little did you know that you are targeting assassins who once worked for the mob boss. Every fight will be different. Some assassins require stealth to beat. Some with brute force. And later in the end, you will find that you've been working for the bad guy all along.
 
Rpg Idea 
A group of heroes have just saved the world from being destroyed. They've proven themselves to be the strongest in the land, and now that no evil can stand in there way, they can live in peace and spend some time trying to find what makes them happy. They all pick up hobbies such as cooking, gardening, and playing music, enjoying there newly found free time to the fullest. But peace can only last so long, and a new evil has appeared. A new evil so strong that not even there strongest spells or there legendary blades can scratch them. The world is thrown into chaos, as no one can stand up to this new foe, and the heroes are sent into a spiraling depression as they must go into hiding until they can figure out how to save the world once more. After months of hiding, one night when they fall asleep they all have the same dream. In this dream, a voice calls out to them and tells them "The enemy is immune to your swords and magic because its all been done before, the only way to win is to hone your skills doing what you really love." So now the heroes put down the swords and shields, forget there magic spells and enchantments, and go on a journey to master the hobbies they love so much, in hope that someday soon it will help them overcome this new evil thats taken peace away from them. Each character has a different playstyle. One plays guitar and uses the power of music to attack, everytime its his turn to attack the player does a button challenge rythm game sort of like the guitar hero games. Starting out with short riffs for attacks, then as the game goes on, learns short songs, with every note doing damage.The second is a master gardener, his attacks consist of plants that grow over time and have different effects at each stage of growth. For example, spreading seeds that after one turn grow in carnivorous flowers, and after the second turn explode for burst damage.For the third, the cook makes food that the enemy cant resist. Different dishes effect the enemy in a number of ways such as filling them up so there stuffed and cant act that turn, giving them various status effects like charmed or enraged causing them to attack other enemies, or giving them severe allergic reactions for burst damage.I could go on, but this is my general concept.  I hope it makes sense and wasnt too long of a read.
 
By day you hunt and scavenge the forest/caves/mountains for rare ingredients, by night you run a bar selling exotic, consciousness-altering drinks and foods. A relationship sim where you are explorer/bartender/drug dealer/lover... one part Stardew, one part Drug Wars, one part Cafe' Sim 
Do battle with ferocious monsters, cultivate exotic herbs, brush up against a violent underworld, design your own hip cafe, design potent mixtures that lure your customers back and fall in love with the town's seedy underground. A dark and mysterious take on the farming sim genre.
 
A game where you dig mines like they did 100 years ago. 
So, I’m really in to a couple YouTube channels where people explore abandoned mines, and I’ve been looking with no success to find a game that captures that thrill. I know what you’re thinking, “what about minecraft?”, and to that I’ll say that minecraft barely scratches the surface of what it is to mine, with none of the dangers, barely any ore, unlimited inventories, etc.No, clearly from these videos it’s apparent that a lot of work went into building some of these old mines. The men who dig them had to know their geology, when and where to build supports, lay down tracks for orecarts, haul and dump the rock they dug(often chucking them down the sides of mountains, or backfilling, creating stopes, false floors, hoists, ladders, chutes, etc. I want a game that can recreate that thrill. A game where you take on the roll of a miner in the early 1900’s, and dig your mine in the same ways they did. - the game should be procedurally generates above and below ground, and should NOT be made out of cubes like minecraft was. Ultimate sandbox where the player is the master of his world, tunnel deep and setting up a camp above ground. - different geology, some solid and some unstable and prone to collapse- timbering, and building with wood. Allow players to build with wood underground in planks and logs, allowing them to figure out for themselves the best designs. - multi-directional tunneling. One of the most fascinating things I’ve noticed about some of these old mines is that sometimes they dug in unusual ways to maximise the ore return, often digging straight down, diagonally, and leaving fatal pits all over the place- natural dangers, including collapse, flooding, rot from moister, fall damage, deadly gas, and more! - actually having to remove fill and dump it outside. - a use for money, including upgrades, tools, and better above ground facilities or equipment. Think things you’d actually want or care about in real life, or things that would help your mine continue and succeed- deep, dark, and hot. Lighting and ventilation are important, and would be things the player needs to think about as he ventures deeper into the earth. Some mines had electrical wires, some even had plumbing for air.- maybe throw in some fantasy elements if you want to give the game some personality. I’m thinking a cartoon aesthetic would be more appealing to the eyes than overly realistic- first person, maybe a graphic style similar to the mines in Skyrim. For better understanding of what I’m talking about, I’ll link some YouTube videos of abandoned mines.
 
Shoot down Amazon delivery drones with your squad and salvage the contents 
Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland Setting3D MMO Looter Shooter\- Team-Based Combat\- Multiplayer Potential\- Crafting\- Marketplace\- Player-Driven EconomyStory Idea: The year is 2150, corporations have taken over the world. The rich live in walled off Megacities while the rest live in the surrounding favelas. Robots do most things now, including delivering packages via drone. You are a scavenger in a favela that makes a living by shooting down drones and selling the contents at a local market. Sell enough and you can buy a shiny new gun, or a ticket into the Megacity. But, you have competition. You can assemble a team of players or AI to help you neutralize your opponents and defend the crash site until you salvage the most valuable items.
 
Stealth Game in a Fantasy World 
I love coming up with ideas that break a stereotype. For example, I’d love to see a stealth game but set in a fantasy world instead of a modern setting, so no guns, just medieval weapons and some spell casting. I was considering two models:Model 1: Instant death if you’re spottedModel 2: Once you’re spotted you have to kill everyone, but if you’re not spotted you don’t have to have any fatalities, and getting zero fatalities earns you extra gold you can spend to learn new spells, get new skins, or improve stats.
 
Zen Garden 
I quit my job about half a year ago to follow my dream and work fulltime on a VR game. It's great but sometimes pretty stressful. I'm struggling with the well known game development fears. So sometimes I just want to do something very simple. Create a small game where I can just go to town without being affraid of making mistakes and making things scalable for future plans. I did a couple of small games in the past, and I started on my next mini gamejam. Solo gamejam ;) Something that always intrueged me was the Zen Garden in Plants vs zombies. I mean I played P vs Z a while, but the thing that kept drawing me in was collecting the plants for the Zen Garden. And keep checking on them. Now what better way to relax then making a Zen Garden game, in Pixel Art style! I completed the code in a few hours, and did some prototype pixel art work.Prototype screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/xPP7RKUOf course the concept and gameplay loop is extremely simple, plant seeds, water the plants a few times a day, watch them grow during the day, and harvest them when they've fully grown. You then collect coins and can buy new plants. And of course it's a mobile game. Perfect platform for this.My goal was to calm down and regroup for my next VR game iteration. And it sure did the trick. I will keep throwing in some hours here and there in the plants game when I feel stressed about my main game. I have some fun ideas about mini wario-ware like games to earn seeds. And also some ways to boost growth when placing certain plants together. I could even hook it up to a plant database and work with real data.If anyone has some ideas, or if there are any pixel artists out there who want to de-stress and throw some environments and plants together, do let me know! Also if you think this is the most boring and stupid idea ever, drop a comment ;)
 
combat game where your weapons are trainable "pets 
disclaimer: this is going to be disorganised  abstract: you fight using living weapons that you catch/find and train/evolve into more useful forms. actual style of combat can be more or less anything  for any other weebs, picture pokemon meets noragami/soul eater. you live in a world where magical creatures exist that can transform into objects and tools, including weapons and armour. these forms and their capabilities depend on the creature, and can be improved over time or even evolved into something drastically different. you start using completely normal equipment, but can tame these magical creatures to gain a significant edge  central idea: the work put into raising the pets is reflected in the stats of the weapon. higher level means generally better stats overall, while specialised care/training can be put in to improve specific stats  evolution: rather than a linear evolution path, creatures with simple transformations (for example, a knife) can develop an evolved transformation in a variety of specialisations (for example, a dagger, shortsword, or wood carving knife). they can not, however, jump to different specialisation paths, unless they re-converge.  finding creatures: many possibilities. maybe find in the wild, maybe claim from defeated enemies, and so on. similar with capturing creatures; maybe simply tame them, maybe use objects to capture them, consider it open to preference  nurturing/training creatures: **very** much open to preference. there's too much possibility here to list any one approach. think it would be a shame not to have some significant interaction with the world though  possible addition: "mods", objects or spirits that can be applied to creatures or their transformations to change their stats or functions
 
What’s the craziest game idea you’ve had? 
I know this is supposed to be backwards, but I haven’t seen much ideas posted as much lately and wanted to create a question to get it started up again. There are no rules, but I would suggest that you pick it up randomly and quickly then develop from that instead of picking mechanics from different games.- These games definitely don’t have to be successful either.
 
Horror game "from inside a car 
The idea is that the player plays as: a young kid (in first person) waiting for their parents inside a car, at night.While waiting, the player can explore the inside of the car & learn more about the family.-inspecting items or objects are similar to  RE1&2 -inventory is displayed on a "gameboy" type tool that the kid has to pass the timeThe game will continue 'only' by playing the game on the "gameboy" while hiding from the thing lurking outside the car.-games on the "gameboy": •platforming clown•chase racer•festival wars(Note: games are based on the child's past & the thing that tries to enter the car).Not sure how it'll end but what do y'all think?
 
A horror game that purposefully drops the framerate when the monster shows up, but the monster itself renders at full speed. 
The game's engine is made to always render at a smooth 60fps, but at times it will repeat frames to simulate slowdown and frame stuttering. This is done to make the player think the game is optimized poorly. It's made to look like the game's spooky rendering effects, which kick in when the player's character is "scared", are too much for the engine to handle.However the framerate *really* tanks when the monster shows up, even if he's not on-screen. And when the monster appears in front of you, no matter how low the framerate dropped, the monster comes at you at full rendering speed. It's almost like he doesn't belong in the game.
 
The mandalorian game but half the game is basically a baby yoda caretaking simulator 
Baby yoda must constantly feed on small crittersBaby yoda gains various abilities after eating small crittersBaby yoda will wander off if you stay stillBaby yoda will fly your ship if you're not lookingBaby yoda can be sent into battleBaby yoda will be a controllable character
 
What would you expect from a Game, where you are a Druid, fighting back civilization to protect nature? 
I am currently exploring this concept as a game after reading it here.In the Game you will be a __Druid__, and civilization is destroying ever more nature for its progress. You've had enough, _time to fight back_.The theme is __medieval fantasy__.I think I covered the basics:- __Summon/Control__ animals to raid fortifications- __Transform__ into animals yourself (to spy)- __Nature Spells__ (buffs, entangle enemies, damage spells, heal)In addition the game will try to lure you away from nature's path with _corrupted_ powers:- __Technology__ (weapons and armor for animals)- __Necromancy__- __Demonic spells__ (beast-like creatures)Is there anything else you would expect? Please let me know.
 
A Ghostbusters game with XCOM gameplay 
This would mainly be an original story about a new group of Ghostbusters based in Japan that have investigate a constantly changing house haunted by seven powerful spirits from Japanese mythology. You have to decide on which character would be best for whatever situation you may encounter, since they can be possessed by enemy ghosts and turned against you. Ghostbusters from past iterations can be unlocked as playable characters. But besides that some of them will appear as small cameos.
 
A God sim where you have to prevent the humans from discovering they are just part of a simulation in your computer. 
This idea was inspired by the recent Elon Musk interview at E3 2019 (find it on Youtube). &#x200B;A 'God' sim where you have to prevent the human inhabitants figuring out they are just part of a simulation.  Out of your control,  the humans develop more and more advanced technologies over time.  From fire, metal refining, electricity, space travel, quantum physics, etc.  Like to begin with the stars and planets are just a sky-box, and the game is, you have to add real planets before they develop telescopes etc.  Like laying road just before the run over it.  If they figure out they're just a simulation in your computer, then its game over.&#x200B;New Game +.  When you complete the game, you as 'God' of the simulation discover that you yourself are just part of an even bigger simulation.  Now you must prevent the other 'God' players around you from realising they themselves are part of the bigger simulation.
 
A Sims style VR game, where you are one person in first person, and build up a life. 
Credit to u/sverre26, we discussed it in real life (his idea originally).
 
Narrative-based game where NPCs start out as silhouettes/indistinct models and gain details as the player forms opinions about them. 
An example of an interaction would just be a standard conversation. Later on in therapy/talking to a friend the player would be tasked with describing what they thought about their personality. Maybe given options like "Yeah he seemed like a ______." and given options between jock, band geek, etc. The next time you see that character they'd look like a stereotype of whatever option you chose. Talking to them/about them more could lead to changes in their character model. I'm not sure where the idea could go beyond that but I feel like it could be used in interesting narratives. Possibly about how we see people differently based on perspectives, at the end it shows a group photo that can be shared with friends or online as a sort of "wait that's what you thought of that person? I totally got a different vibe." Another implementation could be that you hear about the person before seeing them for the first time. Basically having the conversation before meeting them, but them matching the stereotype when you see them, with the narrative being more about how our views of people can be shaped by what we hear about them. 
 
A Mount & Blade-type game set in the Mad Max universe 
Imagine starting out as just some random dude in Gastown or something and rising your way up a faction, to be riding in a convoy, then leading your own warparty and leading a faction.Could also have Kenshi elements where you start off as nothing (like Max at the start of Fury Road, as a blood bag) and fight your way out of captivity to make your own way and rule the wastes. It could share the map screen with Mount & Blade and have big open dunes for combat where you and a convoy could ride at your enemies. Being able to command other cars to split off and ram enemies, or order individual troops to go onto the roof of your vehicles and repair or jump onto your enemies. Imagine being able to get out of and onto your own vehicle and crawl around to get different guns or to do repairs.
 
A horror game where your microphone alerts monsters 
There's other games with this mechanic for pvp but I think a single player horror game with this mechanic could be pretty cool. I'm currently playing the newest amnesia and I find myself talking a lot to soothe the tension, having this mechanic could add a lot of atmosphere.   As for making sure people actually use it, maybe you could make another mechanic where the mic has to pick up you breathing for your character to breath, or as a less extreme option, make it so you have to use your voice a lot.
 
A survival game where players have to worship evil gods to survive until they have enough technology to kill them. 
 
Make a battle royale game but instead of the map getting smaller, the player gets bigger. 
 
Rhythm Chess - The stupidest idea I’ve ever had 
The title is pretty much self explanatory.While in the shower, I was thinking about how to put a unique spin on an already timeless game, and my mind immediately went “Just make it a rhythm game, duh.”It’s horrendously stupid, but I want to make it happen.The core idea is simple. You play chess with a friend, but you have to move all your pieces synchronized to the beat of the music. Checkmates are an automatic win (obviously), but if the game extends beyond the length of the song used, then the win is determined by a score system that’s a combination of move evaluation (ex. Good moves award the most points, blunders subtract points, etc.) and the score of your rhythm to the music.This idea’s simply a rough draft, a spontaneous concept my brain randomly made up in a few minutes. However, I would like to see what everyone else thinks of it.
 
A game where you play as a butler to a delusional billionaire who wants to be a superhero. 
It was a normal day; you swept the floors, dusted the house, and made the bed of your Master: Bruce Crane. Around 3:00 you get a call from the hospital, Master Crane was assaulted! You Rush to the hospital to find him in a delusional state. You bring him home and put him to bed. The next day when he wakes up he proclaims that he is the world's newest superhero: Crane-Man.  He dons his homemade costume and goes out to fight crime.&#x200B;My idea for the game is a satirical game where you play as a butler and try to prevent "Crane-Man"  from going out into the city and getting the crap beaten out of him all while maintain the house, paying the bills, repairing his car, and tidying his "Crane-Cove
 
I’m on a road trip for the next two days and I want to make a game before I get home. Any ideas? 
Hello! I’m currently working on a long term project with a friend and I think it would be fun to make a game in two days for a little break. And so I thought that this is a perfect opportunity! Let me know your ideas!
 
Does this sound okay? 
A online game with a server of 10 - 20 people that are all assigned role in the former of a "god" figure. Each "god" would have their own different ability, similar to Greek/Roman mythology. The point of the game would depend on the player. For most of the players, they would work together, trying to make the humans survive/thrive, trying to get "followers", and trying to promote there own porpose/ability. For the other players, (1 - 2 players) they wish for the fall of civilization. They would do things such as bring famine, plague, earthquakes, etc. I'm not  sure how long it would last, but, if the humans all die, obviously the game would end, and those 1 - 2 players would win. That is my idea. 
 
What jobs could be recreated as a game similarly to "Papers, please" and "Not tonight" the best? 
 
A reverse hunting game 
A game in which you are the last of your kind, and your being hunted by poachers. It takes place in the African savanna, in the colonial era. You can choose between an endangered tiger, hippo, elephant, and possibly more. Each one has their own perks and disadvantages. The goal is to make it to night to sleep and regain health (and possibly a skill tree of sorts).While you progress through the game your species slowly starts to appear more. This gains access to herds or whatever the appropriate term is. As the population of your species grows you'll attract more hunters, but as a herd you have a chance to defend yourself.Heavy animals such as hippos or elephants can ram their carts or just stampede the hunters themselves. Predatory animals such as tigers or lions can, instead of resting at night, actually hunt down the poachers. Smaller animals such as birds or meerkats have increased escape options, such as hiding in burrows or just flying away.
 
A home alone PVP game where there are a couple of robbers trying to rob a house a one lil boy with traps and etc to stop them. 3v1 or 4v2?? Macaulay Culkin main character thoughts?? 
 
A system combing health and stamina 
So, this system is based on Dark Souls stamina system.Let me explain.You do not have a Health bar. You only have an Energy bar. When attacking, you are depleting your energy bar. The longer you keep attacking (the lower the bar) the higher is your attack damage. But once the bar is fully depleted, you die.When resting (not doing any actions) the bar refills itself just like Dark Souls Stamina bar. Dodging does not take away any of your Energy. A perfect dodge (dodging last second) will boost your refill for a few seconds.Getting hit also takes away your Energy bar. However blocking will slow down your rate of regeneration. When getting hit while blocking, your Energy does not deplete, however the regeneration stops per hit you tank a few seconds.This system is a high risk high reward one. The lower you get, the more damage you do, but you're easier to get killed and you also have to pay attention to how much Energy you still have.
 
An online election simulator in which every player tries to convince other players to vote for them in absurd, meme-filled elections for pointless government positions. 
When you start the game you're shown a simple map of a fictional country that is divided into states, then counties and then cities. Then you're randomly given a "birthplace" in one of those cities and an in-game fictional webpage to fill with whatever you want.Each city, county and state (along with the nation as a whole) has periodic elections for various fictional elected office positions like **Chief of Stuff** or **Secretary of Funk.** It's up to players to run for certain positions in their region and then convince other players to vote for them however they can. Joining political parties, petitioning other players in their regions on their webpages, running dirty political ads on the county newspage, etc. would all could be viable tactics.The fictional country would encourage user-generated lore and fictional issues like "massive florb shortages" or "contagious Toe-Face outbreaks," along with players promising to fix such issues in their own silly ways.Everything is made up and the points don't matter.****I'll be brutally honest: I would expect lots of memes to laugh at, but also lots of toxic behavior to monitor/enforce against. The game would need to foster a player culture that keeps real-world politics out somehow.With just fictional maps, user pages, a voting system and image hosting, in theory the game could work completely on web browsers.
 
A game where you wake up late and have to get to work on time, but everything seems to be against you 
You wake up in your apartment and see that the time is 6:50 AM. Your shift starts at 7:00 AM SHARP. You have 10 minutes to get to work, but everything screws you over, kind of like an unfair game. The elevator doesn't work. The stairs are being mopped by an angry janitor. Your car doesn't want to start and panics. The bus you decide to ride on gets a flat tire. Your briefcase randomly opens and papers fly everywhere. Cars don't want to stop for the crosswalk. Sometimes you have to even risk your life on getting to work.&#x200B;You can even make it where every time you play there's a different situation. For example, the elevator is broken and the stairs are available one time but the other way around a different play.&#x200B;There could even be objects you need to find. Insurance papers, your briefcase, money for the bus, a lamp even.
 
Open World game where the main plot is just side quests. 
Essentially my favorite part of Oblivion was just the side missions and exploring. As soon as I left the sewers I didn’t once touch the main storyline.And while main quests get so much focus on Bethesda RPGs, what if I just want to tell a story about my character that doesn’t involve a world ending event?What if instead of Fallout 3 being about the Vault Dweller and his father it was just about interacting with the various factions like in New Vegas. Off course New Vegas had its ending, but what if it didn’t? What if you got the chance to take out Mr House and just summon his robot army wherever you wanted. Caesar still walking around until you decide to try and storm his base on your own. Yes you will miss out on big set piece moments, but this game is trying to be something different. Not to replace what already exists.
 
Online FSP but you are tiny people running around a dj mixer in between the knobs and faders and as you score points the crossfader moves towards your team's side and plays the kazahkstan anthem from borat on one side and the us anthem on the other or you can choose rap vs metal etc 
The music ideas might make licensing it hard but maybe classical vs electronic would be broad and light-hearted enough to work.
 
FPS where you lose different controls as you take damage 
Would probably be strictly multiplayer.Take damage and lose the ability to turn left, or right, move backwards, or sprint, jump, crouch, etc.There's many different possibilities. You could even lose combat abilities (this sounds like it would already be a game though).It could either be random, or it could depend where you get shot. Imagine trying to make the most out of only being able to move forward, turn right and throw grenades. Lol Thoughts?
 
You would literally just be a bowling ball 
So your a bowling ball and you gotta get pins and stuff there, the entire game
 
Shadow of the Colossus, but you're riding your own Colossus and have to protect /aid them in combat 
Your Colossus is the only way you can defeat the other Colossi. Climbing enemies and hitting their weak points allows for your own Colossus to go on the offensive.You can also have smaller minions spawn from enemy Colossi, that can also climb and weaken your own by hitting its weak spots. . You can fight them on ground or while climbing Colossi.Rather than lose when you die, lose if your Colossus dies.
 
FPS “tower defense” game 
Before you enter your match, you can decide on what weapons you want to use. You also decide what kind of spells you want to use. You can unlock more... with more gameplay. You need to defend against waves of “enemies”You shoot enemies to stop them.. when it gets intense you use your spells. Spells varies from big blasts, to freezing, etc You can constantly be moving around the map since it’s a FPS, get the best angles. Best choke points. Decide what spells your gonna use to work best with your teammates.Certain enemies (randomly) will drop bonuses like CoD zombies, ammo refill, nuke, spell cooldown halves, etc You would then need to run on the track/path to collect the reward. But watch out you can die!!This game is similar to dungeon defenders. But certainly different.You have guns & spells. You don’t place turrets on the path. The game is very open on how you play each round.
 
A VR Game About Being a Kidney Stone And You have To Sneak Your Way Out Of Various Celebrities 
A VR Game About Being a Kidney Stone And You have To Sneak Your Way Out Of Various Celebrities. It's a stealth game. You gotta sneak you're way out of the celebrity body. (I.e CallMeCarson) so for example. I gotta sneak my way out of his shaft and make sure he doesn't feel it. If he feels it, he has to go to the hospital and you lose. If you win, you get a free twitch prime that you can use at [https://www.twitch.tv/twix\_canjuul](https://www.twitch.tv/twix_canjuul) or [https://www.twitch.tv/lil\_croissant75](https://www.twitch.tv/lil_croissant75)    Thank you for coming to my TedTalk
 
A game where you're a cursed cowboy who fights his way into hell to take back his soul. 
I've been playing a lot of Hunt Showdown lately and I absolutely love the aesthetic. I also really love guns like revolvers, shotguns, and bolt action rifles in video games.Anyways, I'm thinking along the lines of a cowboy like DOOM where you fight your way to the devil deep into hell to take your soul back by force. Story: you sold your soul in desperation to get out of a heist gone wrong and although it got you out, it also cursed you to be undying and attract monsters. Maybe the monsters wipe out your crew or something so you angrily fight through hell. Gameplay: you fight through layers of hell and each layer has a boss demon. Enemies are a mix of armed damned souls who fight you (think like people in your characters situation who have to fight for the devil) and melee demons. Basically you should be in a ton of firefights and just feel like a badass who's getting pot shots with a rifle, fanning the hammer, and destroying tough melee enemies with a shotgun. Much like Hunt Showdown, some cool modified weapons are also welcome. Another way to think of it is Call of Juarez in a more explicitly supernatural Hunt Showdown setting.
 
A seemlingly simple and innocent game about a kid delivering pizza that turns into full scale anarchy as you're still trying to get that pizza to someone's doorstep. 
Edit: Bulletproof vests were invented by a pizza delivery boy who lived in Detriot, who get fed up from getting shot at. The player chooses if his charater is a boy or a girl, let's just say his/her name is Riely. A 13 year old kid with a minimum wage job to help support the family, which is composed of a long deceased mom and a crippled war veteran dad who suffers from ptsd. You go to select houses to deliver boxes of pizza, almost at times the boxes pile up too high for you to carry them, and avoid going through some neighborhoods. You can travel on foot, use a bike, or a skateboard or a scooter idk. Everyone is happy, nothing bad is happening... then you meet this one awful person; he's drunk, he's fat, he's mad and rips the pizza out of your hand and complains about it being cold before hitting you. And his wife and kids seem to not like him either. So your curious little ass investigates the house. The kids are chained up (So you try freeing them), there's a rotting fetus in a closet, and his is wife is actually his daughter, and she gets her mouth taped & raped off-screen in a bedroom, then a loud bang comes from there. He comes out bloodied and notices you, immediately holding you at gunpoint and taking you outside. Police scurry, folks crowd in terror, and his brians splatter over your head as he's put down by a newbie marksman. That's where everything goes downhill.Riely still delivers pizza, still recovering from that event, then paramedic vans start popping up everywhere, people throw up pepperoni and lungs. Turns out the last few pizzas you delivered were poisoned by a worker at the so called pizza delivery servce you work for, who seemed nice. As it turns out, the pizza is government owned, as well as a ton of other things. And rumors start spreading out how the men heigher up are using chemical weapons in preparation for a possible upcoming conflict on their own people in a concentrated area, that is, your town. Riely still carries those boxes, but the townspeople harrass and threaten you. At one point a group of people with guns open fire at you before the police come, and instead of stopping, they just keep killing the police until every one of them are wounded beyond being able to stand. This only increases the hostility."What type is that? Extra purge with a side of mustard gas? Suprised you're not eating it yourself, you little s-""Frank, he's just a kid!""Who cares- ah, he's gone."Streets begin to be too crowded from protestors to take them, you use alleyways, are more quick on your feet, Riely's charming smile is now a worried frown. And you get a gun for self-defence too. One day nobody even wants your pizza, then your boss says:"I don't give three shits about them not wanting it, make sure every house has a fucking pizza in 'em!"Some of the townspeople looks malnourished and immediately begin eating the pizza, some slam the door on your foot, some point a glock at you and kick you off the porch, some signal to go around back to deliver it. It seems like they're just as frightened as you.Protests turn into deadass riots, tanks patroll the streets, policemen encourage you while they beat people with batons, you wear a bulletproof vest and a helmet, the pizzas look more hurriedly made, and the toppings sometimes look like they form crys of help from the people making them.Riely's dad has a full blown stroke by this time. And the town turns into a warzone, by now you're STILL GIVING PEOPLE PIZZAS. -Make everyone a cute anthromorphic animal (Aggretsuko, Happy Tree Friends) you know, to make it seem innocent. But dark parts of the setting like blood and weapons are less cartoony and appear more realistic, to emphasise on how out of place it is.-Metahorror, the protag becomes self aware that he/she can't die, and that the player has full control over him/her. *Okay, I know you're here. I don't know your intentions, but just don't let me die again. It's painful.*-Using a gun is an option, you can take a pacifist route too.-Some people are asking if I'm ok, and this idea is somewhat more tame than another one I had that can connect to this one's universe; A bullet hell game about a dude with no life joins the army after being promised a bunch of money and big tittied girls, but finds war very violent and unfavorable. But he's stuck because the player has control over all his actions. He ends up finding himself causing a bombing of an enemy military base, which was used to house refugees. (Hundreds dead.) He is still encouraged and told that it was the right thing to do, and keeps pressing on to the enemy nation's capital. Food supply runs low, he and his team ends up struggling to get out of a grimy desert. In the beginning the game doesnt take itself seriously, with a few jokes and gags being played around, but by now the only jokes are morbid and pyschopathic. It ends up getting to the point where they have to cannibalize, and to some's dismay, they were already eating their own flesh since they were born; after genociding every other race that walks on land and flies in the air, (At least in Europe, Africa, and Asia) dragons only had a couple of meat options, fish, or themselves. Their home country took the savage route. The company's numbers dwindle, same as their sanity. They resort to hand to hand combat, they used to fight in a warzone, now they've become primal huns that leave a trial of death and destruction behind them, and all for their own country? During the fighting their clay ends up collapsing and becomes assimilated into their enemy's... and its for the better.  The protag finds himself in the same room as the "enemy" nation's leader, who has been dead for a while. He's broken, he's a savage, he forgot all about his past life, all he wants is to pin the blame on someone else than himself. Then he gets confronted and is ordered to surrender, that any promises will be granted, as long as he sets down his shotgun. *But they're not speaking English, they're tricking me.* So basically a war that has been dragging on for 190 years comes to a halt, thanks to a misunderstood soldier trying to make a name of himself. At the cost of thousands, at least. (Also another catch for a "boots on the ground" shooter involving winged mythical creatures, is that there's a industrially and governmentally enforced practice where the wings of one are crippled, so "it wont hurt itself trying to fly", but really its so more trucks and planes can be made. And the whole part about them being dragons can relate to a middle ages type setting, since it takes place in a stalemate of a long lasting era of not progressing and conflict.)
 
Any small game ideas from games you played with friends in lower school that would make a fun quick multiplayer game? 
Just like how Mafia is to Among us. I'd always thought it would have made a fun game, but only thought of making it a month before Among us got popular lmao.
 
Multiplayer city war game idea 
I'd like to describe my idea for a game and see what you think about it, etc. This is just a very general draft of the game idea and it's totally open for all of your suggestions.So it is a multiplayer game where before you start you can create your start own map, for example something like a town (based on city skylines) but with the very basic graphic. Then you can share this map on the server and other people can either create their own map (server) or join to your map. For example if five players will join to one map then the game starts. These five players are spawned in five random places on the map and controls their characters from the first perspective view. The main goal for them is to destroy the let's say VIP building (the most imporstant building in the game, the aim for the players). But they are fighting with each other also, because only one person can win the game. Players can find some kind of weapons on a map. The host of the map is also playing but not as a person on the map like them but he has a camera like on the city skylines from the top so he sees all of the players and he has to protect somehow the VIP building and  make it difficult for players to get there, for example he has to build some kind of walls, some security posts, turrets with plots, etc., so the players will see those things and have to somehow destroy or go workaround them. Of course the host has also something like limited cash to spend, but he can also earn that cash from some shops, factories on the map, and players can also destroy that kind of buildings to stop earning money by the host. So this is my very general idea draft for a game, what do you think?
 
A game where you buy more and more items from which the world will be generated for the next stage of the game 
Let's imagine an absolutely empty game world and one coin on your virtual account, you have a list of items (from cheap till expensive) with price, in the beginning, you can buy one tree for your game for one coin and you will start to play in the empty world with one tree, you can destroy this tree and get one more coin, you need to earn coins from your current world to buy and unlock more interesting and expensive items (like enemies, NPCs, decorations, etc). Every new run the player gets the randomly generated game world consists of his items, so the game starts more complex with every stage. What do you think? Can it be interesting?
 
A game where you play as a kid at a school attempting to create an underground criminal empire 
Here's what I mean. The game starts off with you moving to a new school. You're the weird outcast nobody likes. Then all of a sudden the school bans sodas. So what do you do? Start an underground soda black market. You get rich, so you can expand to new markets, like cheating services. You pay off teachers to look the other way. You rig school elections in favor of the candidates who support your enterprise. You plant evidence to ruin the reputations of students or faculty who defy you. You recruit cliques to act as your operatives and secret police. The goal is to rule the school as a criminal mastermind.
 
A procedurally generated game with a story. 
This is part of a slightly longer mechanical idea, but since I'd like to see how you'd improve this idea first I'm posting this as its own mechanic.  Come back in around a month and I'll probably have my other idea up by then.Because of the nature of procedural generation, especially open world games using it, most games with it can't take advantage of a story.  Here are some ideas I have to get around it.  * In each world, the wilderness is randomly generated but there are X prebuilt villages which will always spawn somewhere in the map.  You could tamper with the randomness a bit if you wanted to, like making the water village always spawn near the coast or always making rival tribes x and y be n distance away from each other.  Of course, only the key characters would have to stay consistent. * The game is written through a type of madlib.  A template is chosen and elements within the story are changed without much influence on each other.  The templates themselves could work off of each other to always keep you on your toes.  For instance, the elf and orc working together, the elf betraying the orc, and the orc betraying the elf could all be equal possibilities. * A full historical simulator.  This is something that could be quite difficult to achieve depending on how it's done.  The simulator could have a list of possibilities to choose from for historical events, such as a change of monarchy to democracy, an invasive species, or a war.  This would probably be easy to make a model for, but it would be hard to make the game react to the story. * Use an ai like GPT3.  The technology is getting there, but we're not there yet.Keep in mind that for many randomly generated systems, things that are generated within the system have a chance of all feeling samey if not done well.  Unless you hit a bug or an extreme case.
 
30 Random Game Ideas! #4! 
Hey there everyone! Sorry about the delay on this one, it took me some time to come up with these ones, and well, trim the fat, but here it finally is! 30 random game ideas #4!Previous ones:[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4k3ixr/30_random_game_ideas/)[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4l7xk3/30_random_game_ideas_2/)[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/4qp7mb/30_random_game_ideas_3/)* 1.

Let's hope the one you picked was actually the spy though, and not really one of your fellow crewmen.* 14. Try to stay sane and survive by yourself in a small, but very nice bunker. You never actually get to see the outside world, just the very faint sounds of total destruction and the deaths of everyone above. Inspired by this: http://imgur.com/gallery/mHAKX* 15. An SCP Foundation inspired game, where instead of running away from the entities, you actually play as the organization in a response unit and attempt to secure and contain the unpredictable anomalies when they are found.* 16.

Suggestions for an archetypeless rpg 
Basically I'm looking for suggestions on how to design a system that does not force players to choose one of the three major archetypes (tank, dps, healer). I am currently in the design process of a multi-player rpg. Think multi-player dark souls. I was thinking if every character had access to every ability (with training, similar to Ultima Online) then no character would **have to** play any specific archetype. You could make a warrior who heals or a rogue who tanks. It doesn't eliminate the need for the archetypes but does make them not forced upon classes specifically.If anyone has a suggestion for a system I would love to hear them. Thanks.
 
Zombies in cages. 
Context: 2D Top down stealth action game. Trying to make it systemic. The game's major mechanic is that construction workers build the level while you're playing it.First of all, construction workers can carry these caged zombies. Why would they do that? Because they'll be occasionaly used as part of the traps.That's right. You can release zombies. The enemies can too for their traps. They'll use their ears and listen for footsteps. Their vision is very short and used to actually detect the enemy.Zombies attack by spitting zombie juice at humans. They spawn a puddle of zombie juice when they die. They will smell and eat corpses within a certain radius.A entity that gets into contact with zombie juice slowly takes infection damage.A antidote item can stop the infection. Enemies will also use it if they can.If a entity dies due to an infection, they turn into a zombie version of themselves.Think I'll make the zombies a little faster or buffer than the average guard because they won't be appearing in masses.Does this sound fun?
 
a 2d puzzle platformer where you have to change your graphics settings to progress 
for example: a ramp thats too steep to climb, and you overcome it by lowering your resolution a shit ton and the ramp turns into stairs.
 
“People of Walmart”-themed battle royale 
Think Fall Guys but it takes place inside a crazy shopping center and everybody could be fighting over some item in the store. Character customization would include all the People of Walmart greats.
 
A racing game where players compete to get the last parking spot across town in a ruthless Battle Royale musical chairs format with brutal collision physics 
 
RPG that instead of having a huge open worlda map, you have a small space but you can move through time. 
So actually an "Open Time" RPG where instead of having a huge map/world, you have a smaller space that you cannot leave, could be as small as a room or a building, or a space ship, or a small city like rapture. Then you can move freely back and forth in time and your actions would affect how the place involves in time. There would also be other time travelers who based on your actions might also affect the timeline so the past might also change without you knowing.
 
Rougelike where bosses are the remains of dead players. 
Get a new highscore and your current character will turn into a boss that other players may have to fight when they reach a matching score.
 
Human anatomical sandbox simulator 
This is an educational and slightly humorous sandbox game inspired by medical charts, where you get to interact with a human anatomical body with x-ray vision that allows you to view blood and organ functions.INSPIRATIONS: Surgeon simulator, ragdoll games, sandbox games.GAMEPLAY1. FOOD DIGESTION: Feed the character with various foods and watch them break down in the stomach and the nutrients absorbed into the bloodstream. Intoxicants and stimulants will affect the function of the brain and organs. This will teach people the importance of a good diet.2. BLOOD FLOW + POSING: put the character into funny poses by bending their body parts and spin them around to see how blood flow gets constricted, this will teach people the effects of bad posture.3. ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES: You can place a heater closer or further away to see its effect on sweating and increased metabolism. You can also submerge the character in water, watching the water getting into their lungs.4. MEDICAL PROCEDURES: After the character has been drowned, you must rescue and perform emergency procedures on them with electrical equipment, injections, cutting, and sewing.5. SELF-EXPLORATION: explore the human body by placing toys including but not limited to vibrators, dildos, and rabbits inside any but all orifices. Some openings are small at the beginning but with gradual adaptation, they will become bigger and more comfortable over time, demonstrating Darwin's law of evolution. Lactation is a must.6. FUNNY HAIRCUT SIMULATOR: The character's beard, hair are constantly growing. Look after the body with regular trimming or get creative by giving them exotic hair cuts.This will be a simulator that's not only fun but can also teach people about bodily functions, it could also go in the direction of becoming a supplementary training tool for medical students.Thank you for reading!
 
A body horror game where the player slowly turns into a hideous monster as the game progresses 
It would be a first-person survival game where the final objective is to find the antidote to your condition. The only way you would be able to check how you currently look like is through mirrors positioned around the map.
 
a game where you are the final boss 
the name says it all, you are the final boss of the game you are playing and there would be a few levels of varying difficulty like for example: easiest difficulty would be a person who finished the game letting their friend who never played it play, and the hardest difficulty would be a world record holding speedrunner who knows all the tricks to defeat you
 
An advice for ppl giving ideas 
Hey, I'm a beginner at developing, still learning, and I wanna say that if you just have a tiny idea, like a simple game mechanic, don't always try to develop a lore or just doing a huge story about it, it's fine, small and simple game mechanic ideas are as valuable as full "game ideas". It may even be better to me. Thank you for reading me, keep developing and giving ideas people !
 
Roguelike where you continue playing as the enemy, that defeated you. 
You start in the middle of the dungeon. You possess a hero and you want to go deeper down, where enemies get thougher.When you die, you switch roles and want to progress upwards and escape the dungeon. But the heroes become stronger closer to the surface.So there are two possible Endings for you._Not perfect but maybe somebody can expand on it.._
 
A horror game that purposefully drops the framerate when the monster shows up, but the monster itself renders at full speed. 
The game's engine is made to always render at a smooth 60fps, but at times it will repeat frames to simulate slowdown and frame stuttering. This is done to make the player think the game is optimized poorly. It's made to look like the game's spooky rendering effects, which kick in when the player's character is "scared", are too much for the engine to handle.However the framerate *really* tanks when the monster shows up, even if he's not on-screen. And when the monster appears in front of you, no matter how low the framerate dropped, the monster comes at you at full rendering speed. It's almost like he doesn't belong in the game.
 
Things you dislike from game genres you like 
The point of this thread it's to get an idea of what other players dislike about their favorite game genre and take those ideas to create a concept either to make it better or rework that very thing.i'm posting mine as example:FPS* *Guns that feel & look like a toy:* unless it about toys gunfighting then it doesn't apply, since the first doom, i think it's outdated the idea of small guns doing little damage, the pistol becomes useless the moment you get another weapon. In Return to Wolfenstein Castle, and Wolfenstein: New Order, did an amazing job for giving an use for the 'low' damage weapons.
 
My Pet Planet" , a virtual pet game, where the pets are planets. 
Functions like a virtual pet idle game, which progresses without you.Foster _cold dead rocks_ into flourishing and thriving eco systems..Thats it..
 
Gordon Ramsay VR cooking sim where he berates you 
I’m talking Hell’s Kitchen style rather than kitchen nightmares, etc.Multiplayer where you and your friends are line cooks and have to serve a night whilst Gordon Ramsey gets in your face and has different reactions depending on your success or failure.I hope I’m not alone on this
 
A post-apocalyptic game where all your information is from before the apocalypse 
So for instance your map of a city would be for the city as it was before the apocalypse, meaning you can't rely on it completely while exploring. I just thought this was a cool idea IDK
 
A cyber-noir game about fast-travel, in which you track down and kill innocent "outlaws" who survived teleportation. 
The game takes place in a future in which teleportation booths are ubiquitous. **Fast-travel using these is central to the plot and to the gameplay.** Not just the player can fast-travel, but so can NPCs. They use it to get to work, to travel for vacation, to take their lunch break in Tokyo, etc. Society has accepted teleportation booths.#### It's no secret: Teleportation booths clone you and then kill you.The population has generally come to accept this. *You* always feel like *you* when you come out of the other side, after all. Unfortunately, teleportation booths do have a slim failure rate. Once in a while, the booths will fail to destroy the original. These survivors are disavowed by society and declared outside of the protection of law.This is where you come in. You play a marshal who is tasked with tracking down and eliminating these [outlaws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw)For each case you'll visit their home and workplace for clues to where they may be hiding. You'll interview relatives, colleagues, aquaintances *and even the rightful* clone himself/herself. The outlaw will also ping on a map if they were tagged by a nearby biometric scanner. Each case is like a detective mystery that may end in a confrontation or gunfight.### Fast-Travel as a Gameplay MechanicThe basic game idea came from wondering, "what if fast-travel wasn't just a small gameplay feature, but instead was the core mechanic of a game?"The game world would be about as large as the several city hubs in recent Deus Ex games, just large enough to make fast-travel useful at walking speed (there's no need for cars in this future). Everyone can fast travel *except outlaws* since the network has already flagged them. The rightful clones of the outlaws are also affected since there's no way to tell them apart.This is important because any time an outlaw is pinged on the map, it means they *have* to be within a certain radius (based on time and walking speed). On the other hand, you can zip all over the place to check nearby scanners or to outmaneuver your target.It's so useful to you that it would be a shame if—in the final act of the game—a teleporter malfunctioned on you and now you become the hunted.
 
A platformer that purposely and ironically doesn't use common mechanics (like jumping). 
So basically the whole game would be written as sort of a comedic satire of trope mechanics in platformers, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and criticizing the player and developers.I imagine a tutorial where the player character gets to the first obstacle which is like a comedically low wall, and realizes that he does not have the ability to jump, breaks the fourth wall and says something to the effect of "Who the duck doesn't know how to jump". The rest of the game would be sort of like puzzles where you have to figure out how to progress through seemingly simple platforming scenarios where you use object and mechanisms to push, pull, throw you where you need to go. You could even break the fourth wall and use things like the window size or mouse cursor as game mechanics. All the while the player character mouthing off jokes at the ridiculous nature of it all.At the end of the game you would finally get the ability to jump but wouldn't be able to use it because the game is over. or maybe you could backtrack and see how hilariously easy the game is with the ability to jump.
 
“The Guy In The Chair” - a game where you play as the hero’s “guy in the chair”, bringing up information, schematics, coordinates, hack security systems, disable power grids, etc on the fly as your heroic counterpart fights the big bad. 
You work for a sort of superhero call-center that provides as-needed support to the various super heroes of the world. As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.For the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). For the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.For the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.The interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.You would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.There would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.All from the comfort of your chair.
 
A game where the villain gets tired of waiting for the hero to arrive to fulfill his role and goes on an adventure to find him. 
The characters (npc) were aware that they are in a video game and that they must fulfill their roles, they did not mind dying because they would reappear later. The villain could always see the position of the player from his castle to have the whole environment ready and organized for when he arrives (something like he loves drama) but on one of those occasions after finishing the game and restarting the world the main character no longer appears on his monitor.The rumor that the main character has died without reviving spreads throughout that world causing no one to respect the roles and start wars for control for fear of dying at some point, and the villain tries to find him through the levels, having to beat the bosses who were in charge of him but now have become stronger to take control since they no longer need to be at a standard level according to their roles and they will also steal and use the items and weapons that the main character had to have used throughout the story
 
RPG that instead of having a huge open worlda map, you have a small space but you can move through time. 
So actually an "Open Time" RPG where instead of having a huge map/world, you have a smaller space that you cannot leave, could be as small as a room or a building, or a space ship, or a small city like rapture. Then you can move freely back and forth in time and your actions would affect how the place involves in time. There would also be other time travelers who based on your actions might also affect the timeline so the past might also change without you knowing.
 
A horror game set in the old west where you play as a woman accused of being a witch 
The game would start out with you escaping your holding cell. You'd proceed into the Rocky Mountains while being tracked by men with bolt/lever action rifles. As night falls during your escape, weird and spooky things could be in the forest that slowly reveal that you are indeed a witch which is something the player character did not know and/or refuses to believe.
 
A rogue-like where you play as a fish that was thrown down the drain 
Rogue-like where you- as a fish- need to navigate througha complex pipe system arranged in rooms and corridors, where you must avoid environmental dangers (waste coming down from pipes, broken pipelines) and enemies such as rats, rotten food and others. Can choose from several fish with different abilities. Objective is to reach the ocean alive.
 
I had this Horror game idea and I have to tell someone 
Maybe someone already thought about this idea but this is how it goes.Basically you know how most horror games are in complete darkness and scary ambient sounds and things cracking squecking etc.Well I tought about a horror game simply called "Hidden in plain sight". Watch this, its a bright sunny day birds a chriping sun is shining the grass is green everything is nice.You fell relaxed and safe. But the creature that is trying to get you is simply hidden in plain sight. You can spot it if you look good enough but it is so well hidden in the surounding and its just easing closer and closer.Now I would love to have people aswell and you walk trough them and maybe someone like behind you creapily goes 'Psst hey' and you turn around and its just a normal person like asking you for directions but maybe the next time it is not. The creature is extremly good at blending in.I dont know the objective, I have not tought about it thoroughly only the broad concept. Also I would not like a bullshit aproach to killing it like if you see it you can pop a 45. In his skull and the game is finished no collecting magic stone from my grandmother that she hid in her ass.English is not first language sry
 
A God sim where you have to prevent the humans from discovering they are just part of a simulation in your computer. 
This idea was inspired by the recent Elon Musk interview at E3 2019 (find it on Youtube). &#x200B;A 'God' sim where you have to prevent the human inhabitants figuring out they are just part of a simulation.  Out of your control,  the humans develop more and more advanced technologies over time.  From fire, metal refining, electricity, space travel, quantum physics, etc.  Like to begin with the stars and planets are just a sky-box, and the game is, you have to add real planets before they develop telescopes etc.  Like laying road just before the run over it.  If they figure out they're just a simulation in your computer, then its game over.&#x200B;New Game +.  When you complete the game, you as 'God' of the simulation discover that you yourself are just part of an even bigger simulation.  Now you must prevent the other 'God' players around you from realising they themselves are part of the bigger simulation.
 
Karma game based on reincarnation. You start as an single cell and if you are a good cell based on what you do you get to become a higher organism. Continue until you become a human and then on until you reach enlightenment. If you are bad you go back and have to repeat until you are good enough. 
This game may already exist. If so please let me know. Thanks everyone. Im amazed so many people like it. I have played spore but obviously that worked with continuous generations etc.Thank you for my first silver x
 
A survival game but instead of being in the wilderness or post-apocalypse, you're a homeless person in a contemporary Urban city. 
 
A visual novel that gradually gets more disturbing depending on how late at night/early in the morning you play it. 
This would have to be based on your time zones (sort of like Mystic Messenger I believe). Basically, it's a visual novel/horror game that would sort of break the fourth wall, much like *Doki Doki Literature Club.* The setting of the game is an average Japanese high school with adorable anime girls that you can bond with. At the end of the day, the girl you interacted most with that day will give you real-life advice, normally something simple, like "Remember to stay hydrated!" or "If you're having trouble finding friends, just put yourself out there!" After giving this advice, you can explore the school, go to clubs, or go straight home to work on homework for five minutes real-time until the sleeping cutscene (six seconds real-time).However, the first time you play through a day at school, the girl you interacted with will tell you: "You best not stay up too late. You don't want to know what happens when you stay up too late." The times for "normal" gameplay would be 7:30 A.M to around 11:30 P.M. The game is still playable for the half hour between 11:30 and midnight, but slightly more unsettling, with the days taking longer and the girls taking on slightly glitched appearances, with sometimes distorted text, and advice also being distorted (instead of "Remember to stay hydrated," it would be "Remember to d̶͈͝š̵̡f̷̘͛ģ̶̓t̶͎̃ǹ̴͉ỳ̵̧s̸̩̅b̵͙̚f̶̗̃ḁ̸͒y̷̰͝ū̷̩d̴͔̋h̸̠͂f̴͉̓v̸̟̈ĝ̴̘ý̷̫ẃ̶̙f̴͇͗u̵̟͒s̷̟̈ȗ̴̬e̴̬̕k̴̰̾h̴͚̄ŕ̶̡g̶͉̋") At midnight, it goes to full-on horror game, and even if you're at home or in the sleep cutscene, the MC will be sent to the lobby of the school. Text will flash on the screen that says "I told you not to stay up late." Your goal is now to survive the school (filled with students taking on forms of indescribable horror, the main girls being the fastest and most powerful) until normal gameplay hours resume, or you can simply choose to save your progress, close out the game and go to bed.If you choose to continue with a save file made during horror hours, then where you pick up depends on when you resume playing. If you continue with that save file during normal hours, then you will be back in normal hours. However, the reverse happens if you play during horror hours on a save file made during normal hours.Thoughts?
 
A game where the day restarts over and over again (like Groundhog Day) but you play as a different character every time. 
Let’s say there are about 20 - 30 characters and everyday after 12pm or if you die you restart the day and you are somebody else. From an office worker to a random high school student to the mayor to a hobo on the street. Your goal is pretty simple, solve a murder (or another mystery, maybe find out why this Groundhog Day thing is happening?) in a small town. You can interact with the other characters in dialogue and find clues as to what’s happening. You will have a journal that will transfer between characters but any other items will be gone. Certain characters have certain benefits and disadvantages like the mayor has access to more information or areas but he has more work to do before you can actually do stuff with him. When you play as the homeless guy you can move and do things the entire day but of course you start the day broke and with nothing.If I were to make it, it would be in a pixel art top down view.
 
What if the game designer lies to you. 
A game which starts off in classic fashion: menu, options, start game, tutorial......but then, after you get the basics of the game, in follow up interactions with you, the game narrator and UI of the game itself start introducing information that is purposefully wrong and get you into trouble.After a while, it becomes obvious that the game designer is diagetic (in the game world) and is a character who tries to either make you fail, or use you to get to his own goals (which don't align with your own goals as a character or player). Hence, the game designer is the bad guy too.. xDI guess this is a similar idea to Stanley Parable (or Nier), and invites you to think about the following: how can the Game Designer lie to the player?I'm not talking badly designed UI or UX here, I'm specifically talking about "lying" to the player as a game challenge that the player must overcome. Maps with wrong information, tutorial pop-ups that invite you to do mistakes. Narrator that purposefully lie. And most interesting of them all....the game trains you on mechanics on one way, and then, throws a challenge that requires you to do the opposite of what you learned...
 
A strategy game where the aim is to keep the war going so you can sell your weapons and keep making money 
Would have an interface similar to plague inc.
 
Don’t Nap - A game in which you are a preschooler, it’s nap time, and you don’t want to take a nap. 
Had this idea because I work at a preschool and a rendition of this is played every day at nap time. I have no knowledge of game design, so I’m sorry if the flair is wrong. I’m guessing the AI would be really difficult to program.- 3D unity game- Stealth-focused gameplay. Similar to Slender or Baldi’s Basics.________________Concept/tagline: It’s nap time at the preschool you attend. But you don’t want to nap, you want to play! So you must sneak around and play with all the toys. But watch out, if the teacher catches you, you’re toast!____________________- objective: There are several different toys (blocks, matchbox cars, dolls, etc) laying around a classroom. You must “play” with all of them without being spotted by the teacher. In order to play with a toy, you walk up to it, press a button on your keyboard/controller, and a 2 second progress timer bar counts down. After this, you have officially “played” with that toy and can move onto the next one. After you’ve played with all the toys, you get a message saying that you’re sleepy, and you must return to your cot. Upon returning to the cot, you win the game.________________________- The teacher: the teacher patrols the classroom. They get more vigilant after every toy you play with. Starting out just reading a newspaper; and actively searching for you by the last toy. If the teacher sees you, they give chase, and they’re faster than you so escaping is possible but not recommended. If the teacher catches you once, they put you back in your cot, and go into the hardest mode for the remained of the game. If you get caught again, it’s game over.________________________- Your cot. You start the game on your nap time cot. If you are on your cot, you are safe, and if the teacher sees you on the cot, they will return to their desk temporarily. Once you’ve played with a few toys, of the teacher sees your cot empty, they will actively search for you instead of passively patrolling._________________- Other obstacles. There are a few other obstacles to avoid that will alert the teacher to your location. The teacher will go to the obstacle to investigate, so if you trigger one, it’s best to get away from that general area as quickly and quietly as possible.- Loose items. Loose items can be knocked over if you’re not careful. They will make a noise that draws the teacher to them.- Squeaky floorboards. There’s a subtle visual cue for which boards are squeaky. - Tattletales. Some of the other sleeping children will get woken up if you get too close to them, and will shout “teacherrrr!” This draws the teacher to the kid.- Paint bucket. This is a loose item that can be knocked over and alert the teacher. However, it can also be used to your advantage. When the teacher finds the paint spill on the floor, they will spend ten seconds or so cleaning the spill and ignore you. It’s placed somewhere in the classroom where there’s not much cover, though. So it’s a high risk, high reward strategy.__________- Getting around. You can either walk or crawl. Walking is faster but louder, crawling is slower but more stealthy.
 
A 2D fantasy game in which you cook and invent new recipes for your town restaurant during the evening, but every morning you forage and hunt for exciting new ingredients in the wildlands. 
Imagine *Moonlighter* but instead of running a shop you run a restaurant, and instead of dungeon crawling you explore a procedurally generated open wilderness teeming with unique plants, animals and monsters.The game focuses on inventing/discovering new recipes. It's not just about what ingredients you combine for a dish, but also about how you prepare or cook each of the ingredients that make the dish unique. It's like if *Breath of the Wild* and *Overcooked* had a top-down 2D baby. Customers request a type of dish (a stew, a roast, a desert, etc.) or type of ingredient (wild game, tree nuts, etc.) and you're allowed to do whatever you want with it. The more intricate the dish, the more you are rewarded. You also slowly discover what ingredients pair well and which don't as you experiment with dishes.On the adventure side you find a vast wilderness with a few set biomes. Early on the hero is limited by the starting inventory capacity, few specialized tools and weaker weapons, along with the player's unfamiliarity and novice skills. As you buy upgrades using the restaurant profits and learn how the wilderness works, you're able to travel further, forage deeper and slay the most dangerous wildlife. Since the world is procedural, you can plant seeds to harvest later. Those plants can attract certain wildlife to hunt later too.
 
Supermarket Battle Royale game. You're dropped in a store with nothing in your basket and have to search for food & fight other people. Toilet paper is a legendary loot. Some boxes contain coronavirus. 
Let's go.
 
A flowchart for enemies in a stealth game - use it however you like! 
 
Oregon Trail, but it’s The Odyssey 
What it says in the title.  Instead of a wagon train to oregon, you’re Odysseus and you lead your ship and crew back home to Ithaca, dealing with mythological obstacles and making sure you have enough food, supplies, and red-toga crewmen to make it home.It would both be a fun rogue-like and keep to the educational nature of The Oregon Trail by teaching about Greek History and Myth.
 
Protagonist can't read; so player shouldn't either (?) 
I'm trying to make a game where the player can switch between 5 different characters at any time. They're all teens except the protagonist, who is about 4 to 6 years old.  I thought this might be a cool idea: if the player switches to her, all of the signs, books and lettering in the game become illegible, or, at the comprehension level of a kindergartener. Like all the words and letters get mixed up. (Except for the character's dialogue that pops up in text boxes of course lol.) But idk is this too realistic? Would it be too confusing to the player? I though it might also add some more challenge to the game
 
VR "Where's waldo" esque game where you are given a description and must move through a crowd and find the person 
Different factors would limit how easy it is to find him, like loud noises, flahsing lights, disguise. Maybe you would need to check id on them
 
There should be a horror game where you go into an abandoned military base and for the first half, the monsters torment you and you are powerless and just run, barely staying alive. Then you reach the center of the base where there's a massive cache of insane weapons and then...then it's your turn. 
 Basically, first half Outlast. Second half Doom.
 
MMO where every few months the entire community have a limited time to collaborate against world ending events, and if they fail the servers just permanently shut down. 
It will never happen because money, but I thought of it whilst browsing r/destinythegame. would be interesting to follow at least.Edit: To clarify how I got the idea, every season in destiny 2, a community event will happen (which usually just consists of collecting resources and depositing them somewhere to tick up a percentage meter) but if it looks like the players are going to fail, Bungie just rig it in their favour. Got me thinking what would happen if the players actually failed.
 
A racing game where players compete to get the last parking spot across town in a ruthless Battle Royale musical chairs format with brutal collision physics 
 
An Anti - Battle Royal 
Like the title suggests :a Game where you have to kill yourself as quickly as possible using the evironment, weapons, explosives etc. The last one to be alive looses the game. Mechanics that you can use against other players are somewhere along the lines of: healing grenade, or a bubble that slows their fall, so that they don't die and live longer etc.could be fun, especially with squads (that gives suizide squad a whole new meaning xD)
 
a reverse dating sim. 
you have been accepted into a prestigious school, dedicated to be a top student you will let nothing stand in your way. the only problem is you are one of the hottest guys in class and it seems everybody has a crush on you.deflect, delay, and diffuse the other students crushes on you.join extracurricular activities to improve your grades, but be warned, you might attract more students.say you're gay when she refuses to stop, and open up an entirely new can of worms.nearly get kidnapped and call the cops on a childhood friend turned yandere.get straight A's and go forward to a bright future.thats basically my idea, tell me what you think.
 
Roguelike: Whenever you defeat a boss and then die, you start your next run as that boss 
You start the game with your main character. After you defeat a boss and then die, you play as the boss you've defeated on your next run. Either your main character could replace the boss you've defeated, or to make things more spicy, your starter character could be the final boss.
 
A game where you buy more and more items from which the world will be generated for the next stage of the game 
Let's imagine an absolutely empty game world and one coin on your virtual account, you have a list of items (from cheap till expensive) with price, in the beginning, you can buy one tree for your game for one coin and you will start to play in the empty world with one tree, you can destroy this tree and get one more coin, you need to earn coins from your current world to buy and unlock more interesting and expensive items (like enemies, NPCs, decorations, etc). Every new run the player gets the randomly generated game world consists of his items, so the game starts more complex with every stage. What do you think? Can it be interesting?
 
Two players. One is blind, the other is deaf. 
My first time posting here so forgive me for any issues. I'm not a game dev at all but I think this is a really really good concept for a game and I wanted to share it so it might inspire someone who can actually write a line of code. Basically it's exactly what the title says. There are two players, one is blind and the other is deaf and they have to communicate and rely on each other to survive a world of obstacles. There's no voice chat for obvious reasons so you have to figure out how to communicate with each other so you can navigate through the world.
 
An rpg where after every level you pick one of three stats to level up and the boss fight is a boss with every stat you didnt pick throughout the game. 
 
Your health bar is your sword 
Just a silly idea for a game where you battle with your actual health bars. I envision this as a top-down twin-stick battler where you swing your health bar around to damage enemies. When you are damaged, your health bar shortens, which reduces your reach.This would be a pretty simple gimmicky idea, which could even work as a mechanic or specific weapon in a roguelite-type game.
 
A sandbox game with completely foreign physics. Objects get lighter when wet. An object's momentum is dependent on how hot it is. Gravity is object-dependent rather than world-dependent. Nothing makes sense... and yet with player experimentation it can. 
This is a game about exploration. But instead of exploring a world or its history like Breath of the Wild or Outer Wilds, the thing you are exploring is new physics itself. The game world behaves unlike anything we're used to... and it's all unnamed, uncategorized, undocumented and unestablished.The promise is that the player could get the feeling Isaac Newton had when he realized the actual nature of gravity.
 
Why does health or mana have to have non-negative real numbers / integers as values? Some more exotic choices... 
The most obvious choice would be to allow negative amounts of health or mana. Negative health might have something to do with undeath, a weird perverse state of being where healing potions bring you closer to death (defined as zero health) and damage from enemies makes you stronger. Maybe a world with living and undead beings side by side, with a matter-antimatter sort of relationship - the undead can harm the undead by attacking, the living can harm the living, but perversely, when either tries to attack the other, they heal instead.More weirdly, you might try using values in a cyclic group - the most obvious choice being the circle group - which for non-mathy people is "pretend that 0=1 and the number line rolls up into a circle". Then full health = no health (i.e. death), and healing too much would actually damage you - but if an enemy tried some sort of overkill attack, it would actually heal you instead by wrapping your health around "below zero" to a high number close to 1! This could be the outcome of an eldritch ritual that makes you a creature beyond standard laws of nature.Another choice would be a two-dimensional health bar. (Health square? Health circle?) The origin, or a small circle centered on it, would be death, and every other point would be a distinct health state. Attacks or healings would be vectors added to your health, with attacks tending to move it closer to origin, and healing tending to move it further away, but by some sort of "life force rotation" mechanic you might shield yourself, diverting an attack and turning it into something that heals you - but of course, your enemies can too. Or, if they can manipulate your life field, an enemy could curse you to take "damage" from a health potion this way. That said, you could "spiral around the drain" indefinitely without actually reaching death at the origin, if you're very careful!Weirdest of all, perhaps, might be health (note, any of these could apply to mana, currency, or any other value also, of course) that takes values on a tree - such as the free group on two generators. (Set of all expressions with two types of symbols that look like "2a+3b-a+2b" etc.) Reaching zero / death (the empty string) would require going backwards on the tree, retracing every step your health bar has taken all the way to zero, which would require the enemy to know your history - but of course, the same thing goes for damaging them. I can't even imagine how to describe that in terms of worldbuilding or meaningful analogies. But it's cool as heck.Feel free to use these ideas or not use them, however you like. But I love putting weird math stuff into game designs!
 
You run a shop. It's your job to make weapons and armor which will keep heroes alive. 
A hero comes to your shop and tells you about his mission. You get clues about his temperament from his attitudes and mannerisms. You must build armor and weapons which will protect them where they are weak, and make them more deadly. Dumber and more suicidal heroes grant higher bonuses if they survive. It is your job to become the premier weapons and armor manufacturer for the realm.Heroes you save will bring you materials and artifacts for better weapons, and will sell their old weapons and other loot to you so that you can improve your offerings.
 
We should have weekly idea prompts, similar to game jams 
I would love to see this subreddit post some sort of weekly prompt that could be used to help generate ideas, and provide a place for all of us to post how we would take the prompt and make a game out of it.&#x200B;For example, I was in a game jam and the prompt was "Don't touch it!"  I made a tower defense game out of it, but other people had a tons of other ideas.  It was really interesting to see what kinds of things others made.  So, hopefully something like that can be started.  What would you all do with the prompt "Get off my back!
 
My ideal video game would be survival horror that slowly turns into a dating sim because the monsters think I'm cute >w< 
 
A New Take On “Loot Based Gameplay” 
Instead of having a crap ton of duplicates filling up your inventory, or having a bogus ass ranking system where “Legendary” items are weaker then some Common items, why don’t we do this instead: every gear item is common! You get it once and that’s it, it’s in your inventory.But when you find a duplicate of that item, instead of hogging up your inventory it automatically upgrades the gear piece you already have! And ever one hundred levels (which would be really freaking easy to get to with so many duplicates), you can rank up that gear item to increase its rank, letting the *player* assemble a set of Legendary gear *through simply playing the game!*
 
A horror game where you aren't the victims 
The idea I had was a game where a monster of some kind is hunting and killing the main characters except it doesn't care about you as the player. For example imagine a sci-fi horror about an alien hunting the crew of a spaceship except instead of being a crew member you are a generic matinence robot and have to work to save them.
 
Reverse Soulslike - a game where you play as a series of powerful bosses against progressively smarter heroes. 
 
What do all of the flairs mean? An explanation 
I feel like I don't see enough explanation for the flairs (Oftentimes, beginner is misused), so here is a quick run down.**Beginner** \- The game idea itself could be created by a single beginner in a couple of days. (Not that you are a beginner to this sub). **Example**: Pong, Tetris**Intermediate** \- A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of weeks to months. **Example:** Super Mario Bros, Don't escape 3**Experienced -** A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of years. **Example:** Spelunky, Iconoclasts.**AAA -** A game with a massive scope. Would need millions of dollars to make, and would require a large team \~200 people. (WARNING: If your game idea is AAA, it will most likely not be made. I'm not saying change the flair to experienced, I'm saying reduce the scope.) **Example:** Grand Theft Auto V, Persona 5**Dream -** A game idea that's so large in scope/technological limitation that it's impossible to make at the moment. **Example:** The OASIS**Abstract -** The game idea does not fit well into a pre-defined category, and is kind of a genre of its own, or it is a very weird/abstract game. **Example**: No Time To Explain, Manual Samuel**Meta -** What this post is. Discussing things to do with the sub.**Request -** You are looking for game ideas about a specific topic, not asking someone to make a game. (Make sure your request is about a specific idea. Don't make a request saying you need a game idea - just browse the sub.) **Example:** Request for horror game mechanics involving Lucifer.**Mobile -** A game idea that would be exclusively made, or mainly for, mobile. **Example**: Angry Birds**Mechanic** \- Something that is not a game idea itself, but rather a feature that could be used. **Example**: Undertale's act/spare option, Braid's rewinding time feature.**VR -** A game idea that would be exclusively made, or mainly for, VR. **Example**: Superhot VR**Other-** Doesn't fit into one of these categories.
 
A VR game in which you are a tiny alien piloting a human from inside his head, going about your days trying not to get found out that you aren't human. 
The cockpit is like the panoramic ones in Titanfall, and you control your "human" with a bunch of retro-style levers, pulleys and switches. The premise is like Octodad in that you are pretending to be human while doing various odd jobs, except you also have to have natural-ish conversations using your limited speech module.The story and ultimate goal is that you came to Earth in search of your loved one who became stranded here years ago. You were able to pinpoint their location to this corporate office building, so you infiltrated by pretending to work here as "the new guy" and now everyone is giving you random tasks thinking you work in their department.You are certain one of these humans is your beloved alien partner (much more experienced at acting human). You can't drop your ruse yourself, so you have to eliminate suspects one by one while you work among them to hopefully find your love and finally escape Earth together.The humor is very [Strange Planet](https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/) in the way your alien sees humans and in the way he speaks with his speech module.
 
Had this idea years ago, before I joined reddit. 
You start at a character creation screen, where you're given all these awesome options for traits, some of them chosen at random, and almost enough points to max out some stats.After making the final touches and saving, you're taken to another creation screen with less options, and about half the amount of points to go into stats.You are informed that the character you previously made is the antagonist, and you may have to face them later.
 
Story ideas are not game ideas 
So many people post their story ideas here calling them game ideas.  * You're a superhero who turns into a supervillain - comic book/movie idea* You're a nazi officer who realises what's going on and becomes a rebel - movie idea* You're a robot in the future who uncovers the truth about robot society, that it's secretly being run by these things called humans - movie ideaThese are not game ideas.  They're stories.
 
I trained an AI to make new game ideas based on all of the posts in r/gameideas 
Try it out here: [aideas.oscerlot.com](https://aideas.oscerlot.com)It's still learning, but it's been trained on the 15,000 or so posts from this subreddit!Enter a starting prompt, hit generate (might take a minute or so) and watch it attempt to construct game elements following on from your prompt. Whatever it comes out with, you have nothing to blame but yourselves.It can still get stuck sometimes or generate nonsensical answers, so just try again or maybe try a different or longer prompt.&#x200B;Example:  **A game where you play as John Wick trying to get revenge for his dog's death.** It would be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you thought he streets of New York, including the city's iconic buildings, along with your favorite thugs and street scum. It would also be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you on underground vigilantes in different cities around the city.   You can pick your method of killing. Using firearms or knives, body armor, or body parts, or stealing bodies from hospitals and hiding then, or even using the phone app of the game to call a tip or text someone who number strangers who have either high or low status.   If you die, you start all over again. Maybe you get a call from a local police department and the person in front of you decides to go out to the crime scene. Maybe your number is called back but you go out alone. You start meeting trouble after getting called to the police, and even get a call home from a distance police officer who seems to know who killed your family.   I want you to feel responsible for your family. I want you to feel your pain and sorrow. I want you to feel safe. I want to feel protected.
 
This sound fun 
 
A video game where you start with a full skill tree that you have to gradually shave down and make decisions about what you could go without. Plus this gives a natural difficulty curve 
 
A pirate game where you aren't literate, at least from the start. 
Being illiterate means the player sees jumbled scribbles instead of words, and sees maps in poorer detail. Successfully navigating maps, observing the signs outside of establishments, and other things like that slowly make you more literate.
 
Two character game, one blind, one deaf 
So basically a first person game where you have two characters ( one is blind and one is deaf) and your naviagating through a mansion or cave or seomthing trying to escape together. Obviously your characters are together, maybe linked so deaf character leads blind chracter. Your job is to escape the place your by finding hints and tools and what not about the location by seeing objects using the deaf character, and then swapping minds with the blind character to listen out for any noises coming from places, which would get louder or quieter if you turn towards it and move closer or further away from it, and then you can swap back to the deaf person, see where your blind friend has moved to, and figure out where the sound you heard was coming from and it would lead to more discoveries into helping you get out. The deaf character would have absolutely no sound in game, including menu and opening inventory and stuff, while the blind character could have a blank screen (maybe something on it to not completely make it black, or even better have a sound wave type thing appear if your facing a sound with the source (a dot) so you know where to move to to show the deaf counterpart the location). Hope that makes sense.
 
A Dungeon Crawler, quite literally 
You were on some epic quest, but unfortunately your whole lower body got ripped off, and now you have to make it through the dungeon without dying by enemies or bleeding out.This might be the stupidest idea I had so far, but it sounds like fun.
 
A game where you are the universe's most important merchant. 
So you know how right before a big boss fight, there's always a merchant who sells you a bunch of stuff? You would play as that merchant. There would be some strategy involved when it comes to obtaining the best weapons/potions, managing money, etc. You would also have to park your station really close to where the boss entrance is and you have to track the heroes of the story to make sure you beat them to their location or the world is doomed. I imagine an eccentric character with a suitcase/backpack that unfolds into a portable merchant station. Maybe you would even have a pet falcon or a dog that can scout ahead and gather information about a good place to set up. This merchant's goal would be to acquire the absolute best material to increase the odds of the heroes' survival. There'd be all sorts of obstacles in your path.
 
A Twist Isn't A Game Idea 
I've seen like 50 "An RPG but you start with all skills and have to choose ones to get rid of over time" posts. It's such a bad idea, and it gets upvoted every time.There are reasons games are the way they are, you can't just throw an edgy twist on a core game mechanic for no reason and call it a game idea.
 
A game like the modern Hitman games, except with "silent drop-in multiplayer" (you aren't told how many players are sharing your world or who they are) and any player can get bonus scores for making another player get caught. 
It's a stealth game in levels full of NPCs and you start each single-player mission with a randomized character appearance. **It's not an assassination game;** rather, your story mission objectives range from things like stealing documents and finding a target's password, to planting bugs in a room and reverse-pickpocketing to plant evidence on an NPC. You still have some non-lethal combat options which are mostly used to steal disguises.The twist is that you can be dropped into a level that already has other players hidden in it going about their own story missions.####You can't assassinate each other.Instead, if you spot some NPC acting like a human *you can report them.* You see, a main feature of this game is the ability to mislead guards (and other NPCs) by walking up to them and reporting suspicious activity. You get a prompt to give them a description and/or location, which leads them investigate or call it in (which in turn might clear a path for you if they leave). If your shenanigans lead to them getting caught, you get a sweet bonus. You might even disguise yourself as a guard NPC to scare them into trouble if you're confident they won't realize you're just another player.There are more ways to mess with other players, such as throwing something loud near them, locking doors on them or planting a tracking device in their pocket (inventory), to name a few examples. Finding other players is a little rare (especially since they tend to be blending in as best they can), but it's just common enough that you're always on edge.
 
A battle royale but lava rises from the floor instead of the circle shrinking 
That’s it
 
A game where you are a ghost in a cemetery that can enter the graves of dead people and change their past. 
When walking through the cemetery you could read the graves and the causes of death, or see family members murmuring (in text or voices) some regret about their loved ones giving a clue of how they died and that they could have avoided it. The ghost could "enter" the graves and enter a level that represents the exact moment of that person's death, and the player could choose to take an action to save or not save that person, and if they do so when they return to the graveyard, the grave disappears.To make it more interesting, you could make a limit of trips for the ghost since each time it exhausts its own vital energy, and it could also make a connection between the lives of people, in such a way that if one is saved this is change the future for others. The end could be that the character is saved through a certain combination of people whose futures were changed. And make this one have no memories of his death.
 
A game where you literally watch paint dry 
It's like a walking simulator but for those who don't even feel like walking. You sit in a room with a single freshly painted wall. The room has no way out but it is furnished with some interactable items. A coffee machine. A coffee table. A coffee table book. Some items unrelated to coffee. You fuck around with them.The game is narrated by a British sounding man, supposedly the game's developer. Together you pass the time. It's not very fun. It's somewhat novel. It's very pretty.After a few hours, you walk up to the wall to check the layer of paint with your index finger. You weren't patient enough and ruined the paint job. Game over.
 
Tower defence game where you are a moving power source. 
You are a mobile power source. Turrets withing a range near you get power and turn of when you leave. You may also only build turrets near you.To make things interesting, you can have stationary batteries that charge up when you are nearby. They will continue to deliver power to nearby turrets until they themselves run out of charge.
 
A multiplayer haunted house game in which AI demons will kill you and possess your body to kill the rest of your team. You can can avoid getting killed by demons by staying quiet on the mic and moving carefully, but then your teammates might kill you thinking you had been possessed. 
You walk a fine line between not getting killed by the AI demons and not scaring your teammates into thinking you were killed and are now being controlled by the AI. If you cry out for help over voice chat or voice commands, you might get killed by the AI, but if you stay too quiet while you approach your teammates for group safety, they might kill you with their melee weapons instead.****The premise is stupid simple: Self-proclaimed demon hunters from across Instagram group up to YOLO some abandoned hospital/mansion/gravesite/ect. (depending what map got chosen)... all to take selfies at randomized locations there "for the gram." Unbeknownst to them, demons are real. Real *vicious.* Now the influencers must split up to take their selfies at their designated locations as fast as possible before a portal to hell opens up ^(or someshit —I don't know, I haven't thought this far ahead. It's absurd though.)
 
An RPG where your abilities are based on how the world perceives you and what they believe you are capable of. 
An idea for an RPG or Action-RPG that revolves around how legends are born and the power of belief.There is no level, talent or skill system. You begin as a generic, year zero peasant... farmer, soldier, sheep herder or whatever with some sort of goal to go on an adventure and make something of yourself. You have basic movement options like running climbing and swimming, can wield and use weapons in a pretty amateurish fashion, can pick up and move or manipulate objects. Now as you progress throughout the game from this point you will be given opportunities to prove your worth, accomplishing feats of heroism or villainy. These may include things like saving a child from drowning, defending a merchant waylaid by highwaymen, scaling a dangerous peak, surviving a bad fall, etc etc. Depending on who saw you do these things and how you did them tales will spread amongst the townsfolk. These will began as rumors but become more real as time progresses and will define your key traits and skills.For example let’s say you save this merchant from bandits and you do so by stealthily using a bow to pick them off. The merchant reaches the city and hits the tavern where he speaks of the wandering adventurer who slew 3 bandits with a bow without ever having been seen. You are now naturally stealthy and make less noise when moving, or maybe you have a smaller silhouette and NPCs need to get closer to realize you’re there. But what if the merchant says you must’ve hit those bandits from something like 200 yards and doesn’t really harp on you being quiet? You now have less arrow drop using the bow, or your arrows travel much further and faster. Maybe the merchant says you hit each bandit directly between the eyes and it was a sight to behold. You now have ‘deadeye’ capabilities or natural auto-aim.I imagine there would be a sort of “telephone” type system for this where each little tale would be twisted and exaggerated as it’s told and spread. You could reinforce the skill by duplicating a similar feat and make it better. But maybe you mess up and fail something spectacularly? Like say you’re running about town and trip over an object. Now the story is “he’s a crack shot with a bow but man does he have two left feet”. You now develop a wobbly gait and are more prone to being knocked over, losing your balance or tripping. I’m still workshopping a lot of this and trying to sort out some fun ideas and example situations. Like if people stop talking about you, you’ll lose these abilities over time. My thought is that this would exist in sort of an early dark ages settings with some fantastical elements and couched deeply in satire. As the tales are stretched out and over embellished you gain ridiculous powers but they can also become ridiculous negatives.Maybe someone watches you fall off a building and barely survive hitting the ground. As the story is passed it goes from a 2 story building to a 4 story one and then to a tower. Enjoy doing super hero landing and not taking fall damage you jump off of something. The core gameplay loop would consist of you just trying to go through life and follow some sort of simple plot (no idea on story yet) while the actions you take and how you decide to play the game can only influence and not decide what abilities you get. If you decide to use your fists to do the talking you’ll see rumors revolving around your brawling ability but as to what those rumors are you’ll have very little input. It may be that you gain incredible endurance because you fought 10 men at once, might be that you get hands of stone because they said you were KOing everyone in a single punch. I have a general idea of a subplot based on all the gods in a type of Olympus looking down from on high and basically using you as a guinea pig for gambling and placing wagers on. They’d give little inputs to screw up sure things, or make you succeed in a one in a million shot.Let me know if this doesn’t make sense. Will update more after I sleep a bit.EDIT: I wanted to talk about progression a bit. There is a theory with the Avengers that reason they keep fighting greater and greater powers, and finding more and more enhanced villains is that there is a sort of cosmic force that balances out evil rising to meet greatness. In the MCU at least it starts with Iron Man fighting terrorists and another engineer who built a suit. As the universe expands so does the roster and severity of each event.I would use a similar system whereas your legend grows so too do the challenges grow to meet it. If you become famed for your skill with a blade you’ll begin to hear about a certain master swordsman who’s making his way your direction. He finds you and challenges you to a duel at sunrise to prove who the greatest fighter in the land is. This could be a recurring rivalry similar to Gary in Pokemon or it could be a primary antagonist and this is a fight to the death, cementing your legend and leading in to a natural retirement for your PC.You’re a famed monster slayer or hunter of beats? You’re no longer fighting particularly aggressive boars, you begin to encounter more supernatural or mythological type creatures. A wolf the size of the mill, a hydra or a thunder hawk is terrorizing a town nearby and you are tasked with bringing an end to it. This could lead to an eventual face off with a dragon, golem or something.I’ve been thinking of this in rogue-lite fashion where every play through is drastically different and the main plot may be just there to give you some direction and get you traveling about the world. So it’s fine to leave characters you’re not liking and just start fresh immediately. The end game goal would be becoming a true legend which would lead in to character retirement and an epilogue.
 
Stardew Valley style game set in a post apocalyptic world. 
I started writing out Video Game pitches recently on my DeviantArt page and thought I’d post at least the Elevator Pitch for some of them here in the hope that they might help someone.The first one is: A light farming simulator set in a world brought to the brink by an alien threat.
 
Dreamt of playing this game, I want it to be real so much it hurts. 
I had a dream of playing this game last night and I cannot get it out of my head. You start out as an evil all powerful overlord who decides to leave the life of darkness and become good. Now, the mechanics of a normal game where you get stronger as you progress were flipped. You start out all powerful and crushing enemies with big strong attacks, however, your character draws their power from evil and darkness. So the further they stray from evil the weaker the hero gets. I basically started out crushing enemies easily but, over time, I'd lose height, strength, and armor. Slowly becoming a normal man and having to use quick, evasive, clever tactics to take down these giant beasts I once rivaled. In the end you start to draw power from light and and morality and use it to take down evil for good.There wasn't much storyline other than that but in the dream the game mechanics were so much fun, starting out as a huge powerful behemoth, then having to adapt and switch up your play style as you progressed. I woke up like, I need to play some more, only to realize it was a dream 😫I know it may seem vague or silly, but it was a dream so don't be too harsh 🤷Edit: I wanted to do a quick edit to clear some things up. First, I never really took this idea seriously. It was just a cool dream I had and wanted to share it with more people other than my boyfriend (I'm a girl btw, don't care about being called 'he' honestly, but I figured I'd throw that out there in case you cared about pronouns) I looked for a subreddit for video game ideas and posted it. Maybe it would inspire someone, maybe not. Had no further intentions than that if I'm being honest.Second, maybe I worded things poorly. The fighting system I had in mind isn't necessarily a reverse progression, nor do you get 'weaker'. Perhaps I threw that word around too willy-nilly. Just in general your character progressively turns into a normal man, instead of a huge demon monster. Thus the fighting style changes. I imagined something similar to the first GoW fighting style where you would press a sequence of buttons at the right time to do scenematic type attacks, to some of the mid bosses, harder enemies etc.. Ex: jumping on an enemie's hand at the right moment, running up his arm, and some neck stabbin'. The further you progress the more you get punished for your mess ups, mis-clicks, and failed dodges etc, considering your armor and such is gone. So in that sense, yes weaker here would work.Third, you would gain more abilities and speed. Higher jumps, some protective light, the less evil your character gets you do get bonuses. There is a reward system. It's not all punishment. But, as has been pointed out, the game just gets harder as you advance, like games do. That's how games work. I understand that. The uniqueness about this idea was the way it happens, and the battle mechanics changing, forcing you to adapt to it or die. If that's something people wouldn't actually like, so be it. I thought it was cool.Fourth, I'm going to say it again for those in the back that didn't hear me. This was all based on a freaking dream. I just played a cool game in a dream and I couldn't get it out of my head, so I shared. Thanks for the feedback and ideas though, some of them were actually pretty dope and made the idea better. I still don't plan on anything coming from it, but that's okay. Have a great day! Happy holidays! 
 
An RPG where standard rpg rules are actually laws, and breaking them attracts police 
So for instance, instead of simply being restricted to four members in your party, you can have up to four, but can also break the law by adding more; however, this would attract powerful police enemies. &#x200B;I also thought that it would be cool if certain parts of the game encouraged you to just *lightly* bend the law; for instance, when saving a prisoner from, like, a tower or something, they'd have to join your party, meaning you'd either have to break the law to take them with you, or leave a party member behind forever
 
You are amazing❤️ 
You guys are amazing. I am fascinated how you share your ideas and help other with useful tips. My heart are melting. Big thanks for all of you guys. ❤️
 
A game where only the antagonist knows it's a video game and breaks all the rules and acknowleges the player and forces them to make horrible choice because "Its only a game 
 
An RPG where you only gain passive skills 
The game starts like a standard final fantasy type quest. There is a demon, you are about to leave a starting town to travel the world to find the means to defeat him. You leave the town walls and... the demon king is right there anticipating your quest.So you are stuck in the town. And it has a magical shield to keep the demon out, or whatever. What matters is, you can't travel. You can't fight monsters, you can't level up, you can't gain weapons or magic.You can only explore your town. And in doing so, you find you can interact with almost everything. You are stuck at level 1, but by taking the right actions, you gain jobs and passive skills. These skills help advance each other.For example, in the library, interacting with a bookshelves just makes you notice how many books there are. But if you have boosted your passive int by, say, talking to old people, you find you can pick out a book worth reading and learn about the town's history. Now you can find a trapdoor somewhere.There is a cat. Pet it, and you start gaining Cat Fancier skills. Learn to fish, then give the cat a fish. The cat brings you a bell that does something useful.Learn every job in town, and explore how skills from one help you advance another.You can fight the boss any time you feel like. He will always completely overwhelm you in power. But each round of combat, you can try some of the job skills you've gained, and at least one you could have will help you survive. Survive all the rounds because you have a broad enough skillset, and you win. Yay for you.
 
Why your Game idea sucks (and how to make it better) 
So I am an amateur developer that loops round this subreddit daily to check for good game ideas. I commented about this in a post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3k53av/did_any_ideas_from_here_have_been_created_as_games/As I said the main problem with most of the ideas is that they are often too big, contain story only, copy existing games or just bad.Other devs seem to agree that the ideas here just don't work for indies and they skip an idea the moment they see a word like "MMO". But no need to fear! I have a simple solution to make your game better!----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Concept**----------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people with a ball that bounces around the terrain? Training armies up to wage wars? Creating whatever you like? Whatever your concept is, include it in the title or on the first few lines of your post. If you don't have a core mechanic for the game, just say so.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Idea size**----------------------------------------------------------------------------As I said earlier, a lot of ideas get ignored because of the size of the idea. If you are going to suggest a space MMO where it is multi-platform and has next gen graphics with celebrity dialogue, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. Bethesda and Valve don't come here for ideas, indies do. So make sure it is actually possible for someone like you to build or else it may never actually become a game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Making the idea simple**----------------------------------------------------------------------------A LOT and I mean A LOT of these submissions try to make their ideas good by adding extra features. I saw an example where someone suggested a racing game with tron like style with fully customisable characters and cars that crash and a mini map and in the end, it would make a developer too bored to just follow a certain rule set. Keep an idea nice and simple.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Checking Before You Post**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another huge problem I see with these games is simple spelling/grammar mistakes. What you are suggesting could be the next minecraft or call of duty, at least try and be professional about suggesting the post. Also, one thing I HATE about posts is the fact they don't paragraph anything. No one wants to read a wall of text, just press enter a few times in a post and already it looks better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Asking for money**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, I haven't seen any of this yet but I am pretty sure sometime in the future I will. Asking for money on your idea may not always be the best. Personally, I think it is a horrible idea. I'll give you a little light in the developers side of the view. We are making games you suggest. If there was anyone getting payed, it should be us. It's still much easier to come up with a great idea than to make a great game.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Good example**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was thinking up of a game recently and I think it's quite a nice idea.So, it is a first person shooter multiplayer game where 2-4 players play in a labyrinth where they only have one bullet. Their bullet bounces around the maze for a bit before returning to the player that shot it. The idea is that the player will be more protective over their bullet and won't want to let it go until they find another player.World set I thought of:A tron-styled game where the labyrinth is a dark black and the players/bullets are bright neon colors. The game would be set in the future and the bullets would look like balls of energy.Tell me what you think! :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Bad Example**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi guys! i had a really good idea that you race a super fast car against other people in an mmo world where there are lots of things to crash into and the cars are fully customisable. There must be at least 1000 cars with at least 9000 different addons. Also, you craft the car by putting metal in the craft window and it makes it into a new part. And when you die, you lose points and then your ranks go down. Oh yeah, Ranks. You get bronze then silver then gold then platinum then diamond rank. You go up by winning races and go down by losing races. This game will be super fun and lots of people can join the world. It'll have next generation graphics and be available on ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, pc, iPhone, android and all the future platforms. The world will be realistic and it will have really good sound and a whole soundtrack dedicated to just the game. I hope you like this idea and if you do, when you make it give me 60% of the money you earn to me.----------------------------------------------------------------------------**Overview**----------------------------------------------------------------------------The smaller the better, the smaller explanation the better. If you don't know how much a game would cost to make, I recommend www.yourgameideaistoobig.com. Thanks for reading through this and I hope people will now understand what ideas are good and what ideas are bad.Edit: Thanks for the sticky and 30+ votes! Hopefully people will use this before posting their game ideas.
 
idk why we don't have an open world rpg that effectively teaches kids how to read by now 
I'm firm on the belief that video games are the future of education. You could fit 10x the amount resources into a video game no problem. At home learning wouldn't be an issue and neither would funding. These kids will do just about anything for in game assets. They'll figure out how to spell any word you give them if you hold character skins over their head. If we can give them that ability they'll be learning faster than you can say no. I can't imagine if this would've existed when I was a child. I understand that we lacked the technology then but we surely don't now. I feel that kids that don't know how to read would find it very beneficial to continue playing and learning about the things that they want to learn about. It'd be unimaginable to watch kids learning core curriculum at their own will.I'm not set on a specific way on how the game should run but it boils down to having everything labeled with words and giving the child the ability to spell these words for in game currency and better opportunities. When a character walks up to a cat they can pet the cat, feed the cat, and above the cat it says "cat". They can click on the word above/below/next to the cat and the game says "cat, c, a, t, cat". In another area they will be challenged to spell the word and be given in game currency if they succeed. The player should also be accompanied with a entity like Navi from the legend of Zelda that helps them to an extent with guiding them to accomplish each and every task the player is given.  The Navi would be the one spelling out each and every word the player clicks on. The world would be filled with multiple worlds. First we would give them a world full of words that start with the letter A, then the world of B's, the world of C's and so on. This would be the alphabet worlds where they can easily walk in and out of all 26 worlds with ease. Another area could be a city and contain all words associated with a city. The last area I can think of would be a world for nature.Just to create a video game like this and to make it as effective as I think it should be would equate to creating a multi million dollar development company with it's sole purpose being to education millions of children.  I find myself falling short. I wish it could be a free video game but if you can make a profit off of this idea, fucking run with it. This is only the start. I'd like to stay in the loop but more than that I want one of MY ideas to actually make it into the spotlight. I believe that my idea has meaning. This is the game I would've wanted as a child. Our education system is dreadful and everybody can attest to that. Further in developing a game like this I'm sure it'll change drastically over time. I really hope somebody takes the time to understand what I'm trying to say.
 
You're in a group call but some people can't hear each other 
The basic idea is that you're Discord voice chat with a group of people but unfortunately, some have muted each other and some have partially muted themselves (not everyone can hear them). No one has the information of who can hear who - you gotta figure that out by talking to each other.I thought of some specific implementations which seem fun:**Figure out the communication network**One person is assigned as the "IT person" who is here to fix this mess of a call. But first, they need to figure out exactly who can hear who. And they'll need some information relayed to them because they (probably) can't hear everyone else. The IT person will draw a graph of persons/connections and submit this "IT ticket" when they're done. Objective is to submit a correct IT ticket as fast as possible.**Task chaos**Kinda like Spaceteam, where people are constantly shouting instructions at other people to complete their individual tasks. Or it could be like a whisper down the lane/telephone style where one person is given a riddle and another person has the answer.**Hidden Eavesdropper**Everyone is given a unique secret key. One person is assigned as the eavesdropper, who can drop in and out of conversations of any connected group of people. Everyone else is a "secretkeeper". The eavesdropper needs to collect all of the secret keys, and secretkeepers only need maybe about half of the secret keys. (The eavesdropper does have the information about who can hear who from the start.)Additional elements?* bi-directional connections only, or also allow one-way connections* change the network of connections periodically during a round* add talking bots for additional persons
 
Road Trip - an online social VR game where you join strangers taking turns driving cross country in cars, vans and RVs. 
It's like a mix between VR Chat and Euro Truck Simulator. When you first start, you're spawned roadside signaling to hitchhike. If you aren't picked up, you can refresh to spawn ahead of some other ride.When you get picked up, you just hang out with people, talk, enjoy the passing scenery, stop at roadside attractions, get food at dive troughs, and all around have a fun road trip. Players can take turns driving the semi-automated vehicle.Once you're done, you can ask to be dropped off. Or worst case scenario, you jump out the window.What else can I say. I really enjoy road trips and they can make a great social setting in VR.
 
A shooter where you play both sides 
So I had this campaign idea where you play as two characters. The twist is, however, that the two characters are fighting on opposite sides of the war without the player knowing. The story makes it seem that both characters are on the same side, as they both recieve the same propaganda and reasons for fighting. The player doesn't  realize that the characters are on opposite sides until the very end where one character goes on a sniper mission and kills a target. After the target is shot, it switches to the other character on a walk in the woods, where suddenly his best friend is killed by sniper fire. The player is supposed to then realized that he was the one who fired the shot. The goal of the game is to show the real effects that war has, and that both sides can be convinced that their cause is right.
 
Roguelike with a single main mechanic: a torch. Use it to attack enemies or to prevent them from attacking you. Turn-based game, but the fire of the torch slowly goes out in real-time 
* Very minimalistic game in which you carry a single element: a torch.* You can use the torch you're holding in the following ways:   * as protection: while holding it and it is lit, enemies can't attack you   * to see your way through the dark dungeon   * to melee attack enemies (the fire goes out faster)   * to throw at an enemy setting it and other close enemies (if any) on fire in a kind of chain reaction. But after you throw the torch you are vulnerable to attacks.* There are torches on the walls of the dungeon as well that you can pick when you're next to them. The fire of these never go out while hanging from the wall.* Even though the game is turn-based, the fire of the torch you're holding goes out in real-time, putting some pressure on you to think fast.
 
GTA, but you are a corrupt cop in 2100 
The year is 2100. The European Union and Russia have merged into the United States of Eurasia. Due to climate change, 5 billion people live there. Overpopulation and poverty have caused a wave of organized crime and terrorism.Rich people are moving to the Moon. Very rich people are moving to Mars. You are not one of them. As a field agent of the Eurasian Security Agency, you have been given three simple orders:1) Protect the people.2) Eliminate the scum.3) Make some good cash.The third order may not be official.
 
I want to play a game where you are in the passenger seat of a car with new friends, and they demand you play the music for the entire trip. You have to keep them all happy with different genres while managing the mind numbing fear that comes with exposing your musical tastes to new friends. 
Bonus points for staying true to your actual musical tastes and not copping out by playing things you aren't that into.
 
A game with ragdoll physics, torture devices, a huge weapon selection, and THIS GUY as the ragdoll/target 
 
An FPS, but you are the worlds best thrower 
Your player has absolutely 0 gun experience, but you know how to throw ANYTHING to make dmg
 
An Introvert’s stealth game 
Introverts are those with a strong preference for being alone. Some introverts avoid or even loathe the company of other people. Your case tends towards the extreme.As you walk out the door, make sure your neighbours don’t see you. Hide behind the cars, crawl underneath the hedges. Go as far as jump into the sewer. Throw a rock to distract them, wear disguises, 📦, etc - have all the stealth tropes in there, except killing.Everyone in this game either knows you or they don’t. Acquaintances will approach you, while strangers will not pay attention until you do something weird. If someone sees you snooping, they’ll speak to you regardless of whether they know you. In this case, you make an acquaintance and your friend list increases.The same people keep reappearing across levels, and it gets harder and harder for you to complete your quests, which range from taking out the trash to going to work to fighting monsters, because people keep approaching you, and you’re too shy to say you’re in a hurry.  You get money for quests, but it decreases based on how much time you wasted chatting with people. By being anti-social, you gain more but also lose out on opportunities. There are key players you absolutely need to talk to, but you have to wait for them to separate from their group.You can buy tools, upgrades and disguises which help you avoid people. You can build notoriety so people hate you, but that also makes it harder for you to complete some quests, by say losing access to vital people and locations. You can accidentally meet someone just right for you and start a family, bringing their piercing presence directly into your starting location. You can drop your job, your family and your name and move town for a lump sum, and restart with no one knowing you. The only thing that’s consistent is, at the end of every level, you will get testimonies from people about what a great, pleasant person you are to talk to.
 
The opposite of a stealth game. Instead of playing as the stealthy predator, you control the guards (RTS-style) as they search for and defend against the hiding predator. 
You control an expendable squad of hunters as they enter elaborate, open-ended rooms designed for a stealth game, except in this game you are on the receiving end. The view is top-down and controls a lot like an RTS game in that you give your squad orders and they execute them. *Fog of war* occludes anything that isn't within the line of sight of your squad, so the enemy can sneak up on your hunters if you aren't careful.A lot of the gameplay is about looking for environmental clues (broken ventilation grates, trails of blood, etc.) to track the enemy. Then you either sweep the area and funnel the enemy into a corner that will leave them no choice but to pounce. The enemy AI will also target your most vulnerable team members, so you can go the risky route and lure the enemy by leaving one or two of your guys alone.Your squad members have their own individual heart rates, and if they're too rattled by losing sight of the enemy or seeing their squadmates fall to the predator, they will begin to panic, drop stats and disobey orders. You can calm them back down by putting a squadmate near them, in which case one will calm down at the expense of making the other a little more scared.****I was thinking about what kind of story/setting/premise could benefit from this gameplay in which you're basically hunting Batman from the Arkham games. This is the premise:You belong to an agency that hunts vampires, and it recently found a sprawling gothic castle in which a number of high-value vampires reside. In order to organize a massive assault on the castle, the agency began hiring mercenaries for the operation. Now you must clear this castle room by room, all the while finding upgrades, adding new recruits and promoting your most valuable mercenaries. The further you enter the castle, the more powerful the vampires that stalk you.
 
GAME IDEA TEMPLATE 
For some background, I'm an intermediate indie game developer who would like to see this sub grow. I know what it takes to make and pitch a game, and find most idea posts on this sub are missing the mark. Use the below template to ensure your idea can be translated into a game.       There is a TLDR copy/paste version at the bottom.            ----------  [TITLE] A one-sentence overview of what your game is all about. Ex: 'The player is a cat, hunting a mouse that lives in the walls.'[BODY]  **Name** (Your best idea for what the game should be called): 'Whiskers'   **Main Mechanic** (what the player will be spending most of the time doing): 'The player sneaks around the house, deducing the mouse's current hiding place through visual sound waves and scratching noises. When the mouse makes a break for the food, the player does everything they can to catch the mouse.'  **Side Mechanics** (secondary features to make the game more fun): 'Stealth and acrobatic movement, using the terrain such as couches and kitchen chairs to get around faster. Multiple mice on harder levels.'  **Story** (The main story idea if your game has one): 'The cat is left alone at the house, and must protect the food under a time limit until the owners get home.'   **Similar to** (games or references that your game relates to for added clarity, usually a 1-sentence pitch): 'Whack-a-Mole meets Assassin's Creed.'  **Advanced Features** (Features that could be added in if made by a strong enough team, but are not needed for the game to function): 'Mouse mode, where the player plays the same level but as the mouse instead of the cat. Multiplayer mode, with 1-2 cats and 2-4 mice. Co-Op mode with 2 cats or 2 mice, etc. Level design mode. Outside mode.'     ----------  While some of this stuff might seem extra, this information is really important for sharing something as complex as a game idea. It gives someone a foundation from which to build game mechanics, come up with a story and visual style, without becoming lost or confused by your idea.  If sharing a game idea with someone feels like you are telling them about a vague dream, then you probably need to think about your idea a little bit more before sharing.  TL;DR / COPY AND PASTE FORMAT **NAME:**   **MAIN MECHANIC:**  **SIDE MECHANICS:**   **STORY:**    **SIMILAR TO:**  **ADVANCED FEATURES:**
 
A horror sim game in which you play as a witch in Late Medieval Europe, you can cast spells, bewitch the townspeople, curse their crops/livestock/children, craft potions, create a coven, commune with demons - all while avoiding detection during the height of the witch-burning hysteria. 
This is my first post on this sub, so apologies if I get the formatting wrong!The game would have a rich character creation mechanic that would impact gameplay and storylines; for example an attractive witch might be more adept at seducing other people, while an old crone or geezer might have an easier time hiding in plain sight. Vampirism, lycanthropy and other shape-shifting abilities could also add to the player character’s options about what their perfect witch would be.  There would be a variety of skills that the player could master: conjugation, numerology, astrology, curses/hexes, transformation and shape-shifting, clairvoyance, necromancy, healing, potion crafting, medicine, offensive magic, telepathy and mind control, flight, resurrection, summoning, luck manipulation, ancient languages, animal familiars, and so much more. These skills could be learned and improved through different rituals or through books and grimoires. About the animal familiars, I think that they would be a fun game mechanic as the player could capture and nurture a familiar such as a cat, wolf, deer, serpent, raven, etcetera and train them to do their bidding, eventually getting to a point in which they can psychically “see” through the eyes of their animal familiar. Summoning entities would play a large part in gameplay, with the player being able to conjure demons that grant special powers/buffs/items or protect the player by attacking/possessing enemies. Necromancy would allow the player to resurrect the dead to serve as servants or assassins. The player could also commune with the dead to discover secrets they could use to their advantage. Crafting would be a huge part of the game, with potions, rituals spells requiring either growing ingredients oneself, buying or trading for them, or foraging for them in the environment. I’ve been doing reading about the kinds of herbs used by midwives and doctors in the 16th Century and I would apply this information into the game. (I’m a huge fan of inventory items in games that have deep lore and backstories for every single item, I feel like it adds to much in terms of world-building.)The player could join a coven or build one of their own followers, start wars with other covens, infiltrate a coven to take it over or destroy it from the inside-out. Lots of interesting story quests could come out of this mechanic. Or, the player could wield power through more legitimate in the “surface world” by becoming the court astrologer for a duke or becoming renowned and wealthy for selling tonics and tinctures with healing properties. Or, the player could just lie/steal/murder/magic/seduce/talk your way to the top, there would be so many different ways to play through the game. You could spend the game as a white witch growing herbs and making a fortune selling potions and the occasional love spell; or, you could summon Beelzebub and have entire cities under your thrall. The main challenge of the game would come from trying to do all these things undetected, which is difficult as even a rumor amongst the townsfolk could send you to the gallows or the stake. But as your skill set grows you can get to a point in which you are undetectable to any inquisitor, or - so powerful that armies fear you and you can do whatever you want openly; or, you become so charismatic that you charm even the pope and become the most powerful woman or man in Europe. I’ve been thinking about this game idea for quite a while and I think it could be a really appealing concept! I think it’d be really interesting to play a character that does things that are normally portrayed in video games as being “villainous”. There’s also something kind of subversive about having a game in which the main point is to undermine rigid puritanical and patriarchal systems.   Anyways, I just wanted to see if anyone else would be interested in a game like this and I’d love any suggestions or ideas about what to change, add or subtract. Thank you so much!
 
This Sub Should be Better 
This is a great subreddit. I doubt I have any more saved posts than ones that come from here. Several of the ideas I’ve found here became some of my first game prototypes and I’m grateful to have found this community and explore the sharing of game ideas.That said, there is a constant plague of terrible posts to this subreddit that stems from the same issue: they aren’t thought out.We’ve seen posts that say:- Should be like ‘insertgamehere’...” then ask for carbon copies of that game- Posts that have no actual way to be made into a game without a time machine- One sentence posts that give no information- Posts that are too poorly-worded to understandThe best posts on this subreddit are formatted with subheadings. They will include headers like: STORY, GAMEPLAY, VISUALS and speak a little on each element. I wouldn’t mind if each idea had to have at least these three basic parts thought out before getting posted here.Look, I get it. This is people sharing ideas freely and that means some will be bad. Some of the best ideas here have been one sentence long. But it’s easy to see that a large portion of those terrible ideas could be chafed out by requiring a bare minimum of thought entered into the idea. I WANT to make a person’s idea. I don’t want to read the twentieth post asking for “Call of Duty but with fully collapsible environment, VR compatibility, and nothing else.”Tell me I’m screaming at clouds, I don’t care. I’ll still love this sub tomorrow and my next game will probably come from here. This is just my thoughts and I want to know what others think.
 
Every time i come with some great game idea at first it seems amazing, but as i work on it, it becomes more and more “nothing special”.Do you developers have the same problem? 
 
A flowchart for enemies in a stealth game - use it however you like! 
 
Dreamt of playing this game, I want it to be real so much it hurts. 
I had a dream of playing this game last night and I cannot get it out of my head. You start out as an evil all powerful overlord who decides to leave the life of darkness and become good. Now, the mechanics of a normal game where you get stronger as you progress were flipped. You start out all powerful and crushing enemies with big strong attacks, however, your character draws their power from evil and darkness. So the further they stray from evil the weaker the hero gets. I basically started out crushing enemies easily but, over time, I'd lose height, strength, and armor. Slowly becoming a normal man and having to use quick, evasive, clever tactics to take down these giant beasts I once rivaled. In the end you start to draw power from light and and morality and use it to take down evil for good.There wasn't much storyline other than that but in the dream the game mechanics were so much fun, starting out as a huge powerful behemoth, then having to adapt and switch up your play style as you progressed. I woke up like, I need to play some more, only to realize it was a dream 😫I know it may seem vague or silly, but it was a dream so don't be too harsh 🤷Edit: I wanted to do a quick edit to clear some things up. First, I never really took this idea seriously. It was just a cool dream I had and wanted to share it with more people other than my boyfriend (I'm a girl btw, don't care about being called 'he' honestly, but I figured I'd throw that out there in case you cared about pronouns) I looked for a subreddit for video game ideas and posted it. Maybe it would inspire someone, maybe not. Had no further intentions than that if I'm being honest.Second, maybe I worded things poorly. The fighting system I had in mind isn't necessarily a reverse progression, nor do you get 'weaker'. Perhaps I threw that word around too willy-nilly. Just in general your character progressively turns into a normal man, instead of a huge demon monster. Thus the fighting style changes. I imagined something similar to the first GoW fighting style where you would press a sequence of buttons at the right time to do scenematic type attacks, to some of the mid bosses, harder enemies etc.. Ex: jumping on an enemie's hand at the right moment, running up his arm, and some neck stabbin'. The further you progress the more you get punished for your mess ups, mis-clicks, and failed dodges etc, considering your armor and such is gone. So in that sense, yes weaker here would work.Third, you would gain more abilities and speed. Higher jumps, some protective light, the less evil your character gets you do get bonuses. There is a reward system. It's not all punishment. But, as has been pointed out, the game just gets harder as you advance, like games do. That's how games work. I understand that. The uniqueness about this idea was the way it happens, and the battle mechanics changing, forcing you to adapt to it or die. If that's something people wouldn't actually like, so be it. I thought it was cool.Fourth, I'm going to say it again for those in the back that didn't hear me. This was all based on a freaking dream. I just played a cool game in a dream and I couldn't get it out of my head, so I shared. Thanks for the feedback and ideas though, some of them were actually pretty dope and made the idea better. I still don't plan on anything coming from it, but that's okay. Have a great day! Happy holidays! 
 
A game where you literally watch paint dry 
It's like a walking simulator but for those who don't even feel like walking. You sit in a room with a single freshly painted wall. The room has no way out but it is furnished with some interactable items. A coffee machine. A coffee table. A coffee table book. Some items unrelated to coffee. You fuck around with them.The game is narrated by a British sounding man, supposedly the game's developer. Together you pass the time. It's not very fun. It's somewhat novel. It's very pretty.After a few hours, you walk up to the wall to check the layer of paint with your index finger. You weren't patient enough and ruined the paint job. Game over.
 
An rpg where after every level you pick one of three stats to level up and the boss fight is a boss with every stat you didnt pick throughout the game. 
 
Don’t Nap - A game in which you are a preschooler, it’s nap time, and you don’t want to take a nap. 
Had this idea because I work at a preschool and a rendition of this is played every day at nap time. I have no knowledge of game design, so I’m sorry if the flair is wrong. I’m guessing the AI would be really difficult to program.- 3D unity game- Stealth-focused gameplay. Similar to Slender or Baldi’s Basics.________________Concept/tagline: It’s nap time at the preschool you attend. But you don’t want to nap, you want to play! So you must sneak around and play with all the toys. But watch out, if the teacher catches you, you’re toast!____________________- objective: There are several different toys (blocks, matchbox cars, dolls, etc) laying around a classroom. You must “play” with all of them without being spotted by the teacher. In order to play with a toy, you walk up to it, press a button on your keyboard/controller, and a 2 second progress timer bar counts down. After this, you have officially “played” with that toy and can move onto the next one. After you’ve played with all the toys, you get a message saying that you’re sleepy, and you must return to your cot. Upon returning to the cot, you win the game.________________________- The teacher: the teacher patrols the classroom. They get more vigilant after every toy you play with. Starting out just reading a newspaper; and actively searching for you by the last toy. If the teacher sees you, they give chase, and they’re faster than you so escaping is possible but not recommended. If the teacher catches you once, they put you back in your cot, and go into the hardest mode for the remained of the game. If you get caught again, it’s game over.________________________- Your cot. You start the game on your nap time cot. If you are on your cot, you are safe, and if the teacher sees you on the cot, they will return to their desk temporarily. Once you’ve played with a few toys, of the teacher sees your cot empty, they will actively search for you instead of passively patrolling._________________- Other obstacles. There are a few other obstacles to avoid that will alert the teacher to your location. The teacher will go to the obstacle to investigate, so if you trigger one, it’s best to get away from that general area as quickly and quietly as possible.- Loose items. Loose items can be knocked over if you’re not careful. They will make a noise that draws the teacher to them.- Squeaky floorboards. There’s a subtle visual cue for which boards are squeaky. - Tattletales. Some of the other sleeping children will get woken up if you get too close to them, and will shout “teacherrrr!” This draws the teacher to the kid.- Paint bucket. This is a loose item that can be knocked over and alert the teacher. However, it can also be used to your advantage. When the teacher finds the paint spill on the floor, they will spend ten seconds or so cleaning the spill and ignore you. It’s placed somewhere in the classroom where there’s not much cover, though. So it’s a high risk, high reward strategy.__________- Getting around. You can either walk or crawl. Walking is faster but louder, crawling is slower but more stealthy.
 
A VR game in which you are a tiny alien piloting a human from inside his head, going about your days trying not to get found out that you aren't human. 
The cockpit is like the panoramic ones in Titanfall, and you control your "human" with a bunch of retro-style levers, pulleys and switches. The premise is like Octodad in that you are pretending to be human while doing various odd jobs, except you also have to have natural-ish conversations using your limited speech module.The story and ultimate goal is that you came to Earth in search of your loved one who became stranded here years ago. You were able to pinpoint their location to this corporate office building, so you infiltrated by pretending to work here as "the new guy" and now everyone is giving you random tasks thinking you work in their department.You are certain one of these humans is your beloved alien partner (much more experienced at acting human). You can't drop your ruse yourself, so you have to eliminate suspects one by one while you work among them to hopefully find your love and finally escape Earth together.The humor is very [Strange Planet](https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/) in the way your alien sees humans and in the way he speaks with his speech module.

A platformer that purposely and ironically doesn't use common mechanics (like jumping). 
So basically the whole game would be written as sort of a comedic satire of trope mechanics in platformers, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and criticizing the player and developers.I imagine a tutorial where the player character gets to the first obstacle which is like a comedically low wall, and realizes that he does not have the ability to jump, breaks the fourth wall and says something to the effect of "Who the duck doesn't know how to jump". The rest of the game would be sort of like puzzles where you have to figure out how to progress through seemingly simple platforming scenarios where you use object and mechanisms to push, pull, throw you where you need to go. You could even break the fourth wall and use things like the window size or mouse cursor as game mechanics. All the while the player character mouthing off jokes at the ridiculous nature of it all.At the end of the game you would finally get the ability to jump but wouldn't be able to use it because the game is over. or maybe you could backtrack and see how hilariously easy the game is with the ability to jump.

A shooter where you play both sides 
So I had this campaign idea where you play as two characters. The twist is, however, that the two characters are fighting on opposite sides of the war without the player knowing. The story makes it seem that both characters are on the same side, as they both recieve the same propaganda and reasons for fighting. The player doesn't  realize that the characters are on opposite sides until the very end where one character goes on a sniper mission and kills a target. After the target is shot, it switches to the other character on a walk in the woods, where suddenly his best friend is killed by sniper fire. The player is supposed to then realized that he was the one who fired the shot. The goal of the game is to show the real effects that war has, and that both sides can be convinced that their cause is right.
 
“The Guy In The Chair” - a game where you play as the hero’s “guy in the chair”, bringing up information, schematics, coordinates, hack security systems, disable power grids, etc on the fly as your heroic counterpart fights the big bad. 
You work for a sort of superhero call-center that provides as-needed support to the various super heroes of the world. As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.For the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). For the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.For the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.The interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.You would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.There would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.All from the comfort of your chair.
 
A New Take On “Loot Based Gameplay” 
Instead of having a crap ton of duplicates filling up your inventory, or having a bogus ass ranking system where “Legendary” items are weaker then some Common items, why don’t we do this instead: every gear item is common! You get it once and that’s it, it’s in your inventory.But when you find a duplicate of that item, instead of hogging up your inventory it automatically upgrades the gear piece you already have! And ever one hundred levels (which would be really freaking easy to get to with so many duplicates), you can rank up that gear item to increase its rank, letting the *player* assemble a set of Legendary gear *through simply playing the game!*
 
Story ideas are not game ideas 
So many people post their story ideas here calling them game ideas.  * You're a superhero who turns into a supervillain - comic book/movie idea* You're a nazi officer who realises what's going on and becomes a rebel - movie idea* You're a robot in the future who uncovers the truth about robot society, that it's secretly being run by these things called humans - movie ideaThese are not game ideas.  They're stories.
 
My ideal video game would be survival horror that slowly turns into a dating sim because the monsters think I'm cute >w< 
 
What do all of the flairs mean? An explanation 
I feel like I don't see enough explanation for the flairs (Oftentimes, beginner is misused), so here is a quick run down.**Beginner** \- The game idea itself could be created by a single beginner in a couple of days. (Not that you are a beginner to this sub). **Example**: Pong, Tetris**Intermediate** \- A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of weeks to months. **Example:** Super Mario Bros, Don't escape 3**Experienced -** A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of years. **Example:** Spelunky, Iconoclasts.**AAA -** A game with a massive scope. Would need millions of dollars to make, and would require a large team \~200 people. (WARNING: If your game idea is AAA, it will most likely not be made.

A multiplayer party game where the only way to kill monsters is to open airlocks of certain rooms on a spaceship, creating a vacuum, at times with your friends still inside. 
* Oxygen can be a core mechanic. Similar to how FTL does it, rooms take a while to refill with oxygen after a complete vacuum.* The spaceship could be a randomly generated set of rooms that players try to utilize best for killing monsters and having a safe place to retreat to.* For maximum drama have the doors open and close really slowly. So when a friend doesn't quite make it, we get to hear their anger/fear.
 
Driving simulator where you actually have to follow traffic rules. And then it gets weird. 
The most intuitive way to track player's performance would be using a score system, but I wouldn't make it too obvious: make bad performances being followed by angry comments by other drivers and chasing cops or something.But then, imagine the game being set in a city where every morning the mayor changes some traffic rules, and you have to read and remember today's rule to be a good driver. Absolutely absurd laws like today is legal to hit other cars and run over pedestrian but not turning right.It would soon make interesting and hilarious gameplay.
 
A video game where you start with a full skill tree that you have to gradually shave down and make decisions about what you could go without. Plus this gives a natural difficulty curve 
 
You are amazing❤️ 
You guys are amazing. I am fascinated how you share your ideas and help other with useful tips. My heart are melting. Big thanks for all of you guys. ❤️
 
An online election simulator in which every player tries to convince other players to vote for them in absurd, meme-filled elections for pointless government positions. 
When you start the game you're shown a simple map of a fictional country that is divided into states, then counties and then cities. Then you're randomly given a "birthplace" in one of those cities and an in-game fictional webpage to fill with whatever you want.Each city, county and state (along with the nation as a whole) has periodic elections for various fictional elected office positions like **Chief of Stuff** or **Secretary of Funk.** It's up to players to run for certain positions in their region and then convince other players to vote for them however they can. Joining political parties, petitioning other players in their regions on their webpages, running dirty political ads on the county newspage, etc. would all could be viable tactics.The fictional country would encourage user-generated lore and fictional issues like "massive florb shortages" or "contagious Toe-Face outbreaks," along with players promising to fix such issues in their own silly ways.Everything is made up and the points don't matter.****I'll be brutally honest: I would expect lots of memes to laugh at, but also lots of toxic behavior to monitor/enforce against. The game would need to foster a player culture that keeps real-world politics out somehow.With just fictional maps, user pages, a voting system and image hosting, in theory the game could work completely on web browsers.
 
I trained an AI to make new game ideas based on all of the posts in r/gameideas 
Try it out here: [aideas.oscerlot.com](https://aideas.oscerlot.com)It's still learning, but it's been trained on the 15,000 or so posts from this subreddit!Enter a starting prompt, hit generate (might take a minute or so) and watch it attempt to construct game elements following on from your prompt. Whatever it comes out with, you have nothing to blame but yourselves.It can still get stuck sometimes or generate nonsensical answers, so just try again or maybe try a different or longer prompt.&#x200B;Example:  **A game where you play as John Wick trying to get revenge for his dog's death.** It would be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you thought he streets of New York, including the city's iconic buildings, along with your favorite thugs and street scum. It would also be a 3rd person action adventure game with a story line that takes you on underground vigilantes in different cities around the city.   You can pick your method of killing. Using firearms or knives, body armor, or body parts, or stealing bodies from hospitals and hiding then, or even using the phone app of the game to call a tip or text someone who number strangers who have either high or low status.   If you die, you start all over again. Maybe you get a call from a local police department and the person in front of you decides to go out to the crime scene. Maybe your number is called back but you go out alone. You start meeting trouble after getting called to the police, and even get a call home from a distance police officer who seems to know who killed your family.   I want you to feel responsible for your family. I want you to feel your pain and sorrow. I want you to feel safe. I want to feel protected.
 
A game where you buy more and more items from which the world will be generated for the next stage of the game 
Let's imagine an absolutely empty game world and one coin on your virtual account, you have a list of items (from cheap till expensive) with price, in the beginning, you can buy one tree for your game for one coin and you will start to play in the empty world with one tree, you can destroy this tree and get one more coin, you need to earn coins from your current world to buy and unlock more interesting and expensive items (like enemies, NPCs, decorations, etc). Every new run the player gets the randomly generated game world consists of his items, so the game starts more complex with every stage. What do you think? Can it be interesting?
 
Karma game based on reincarnation. You start as an single cell and if you are a good cell based on what you do you get to become a higher organism. Continue until you become a human and then on until you reach enlightenment. If you are bad you go back and have to repeat until you are good enough. 
This game may already exist. If so please let me know. Thanks everyone. Im amazed so many people like it. I have played spore but obviously that worked with continuous generations etc.Thank you for my first silver x
 
VR "Where's waldo" esque game where you are given a description and must move through a crowd and find the person 
Different factors would limit how easy it is to find him, like loud noises, flahsing lights, disguise. Maybe you would need to check id on them
 
A survival game but instead of being in the wilderness or post-apocalypse, you're a homeless person in a contemporary Urban city. 
 
MMO where every few months the entire community have a limited time to collaborate against world ending events, and if they fail the servers just permanently shut down. 
It will never happen because money, but I thought of it whilst browsing r/destinythegame. would be interesting to follow at least.Edit: To clarify how I got the idea, every season in destiny 2, a community event will happen (which usually just consists of collecting resources and depositing them somewhere to tick up a percentage meter) but if it looks like the players are going to fail, Bungie just rig it in their favour. Got me thinking what would happen if the players actually failed.
 
GTA, but you are a corrupt cop in 2100 
The year is 2100. The European Union and Russia have merged into the United States of Eurasia. Due to climate change, 5 billion people live there. Overpopulation and poverty have caused a wave of organized crime and terrorism.Rich people are moving to the Moon. Very rich people are moving to Mars. You are not one of them. As a field agent of the Eurasian Security Agency, you have been given three simple orders:1) Protect the people.2) Eliminate the scum.3) Make some good cash.The third order may not be official.
 
An RPG where your abilities are based on how the world perceives you and what they believe you are capable of. 
An idea for an RPG or Action-RPG that revolves around how legends are born and the power of belief.There is no level, talent or skill system. You begin as a generic, year zero peasant... farmer, soldier, sheep herder or whatever with some sort of goal to go on an adventure and make something of yourself. You have basic movement options like running climbing and swimming, can wield and use weapons in a pretty amateurish fashion, can pick up and move or manipulate objects. Now as you progress throughout the game from this point you will be given opportunities to prove your worth, accomplishing feats of heroism or villainy. These may include things like saving a child from drowning, defending a merchant waylaid by highwaymen, scaling a dangerous peak, surviving a bad fall, etc etc. Depending on who saw you do these things and how you did them tales will spread amongst the townsfolk. These will began as rumors but become more real as time progresses and will define your key traits and skills.For example let’s say you save this merchant from bandits and you do so by stealthily using a bow to pick them off. The merchant reaches the city and hits the tavern where he speaks of the wandering adventurer who slew 3 bandits with a bow without ever having been seen. You are now naturally stealthy and make less noise when moving, or maybe you have a smaller silhouette and NPCs need to get closer to realize you’re there. But what if the merchant says you must’ve hit those bandits from something like 200 yards and doesn’t really harp on you being quiet? You now have less arrow drop using the bow, or your arrows travel much further and faster. Maybe the merchant says you hit each bandit directly between the eyes and it was a sight to behold. You now have ‘deadeye’ capabilities or natural auto-aim.I imagine there would be a sort of “telephone” type system for this where each little tale would be twisted and exaggerated as it’s told and spread. You could reinforce the skill by duplicating a similar feat and make it better. But maybe you mess up and fail something spectacularly? Like say you’re running about town and trip over an object. Now the story is “he’s a crack shot with a bow but man does he have two left feet”. You now develop a wobbly gait and are more prone to being knocked over, losing your balance or tripping. I’m still workshopping a lot of this and trying to sort out some fun ideas and example situations. Like if people stop talking about you, you’ll lose these abilities over time. My thought is that this would exist in sort of an early dark ages settings with some fantastical elements and couched deeply in satire. As the tales are stretched out and over embellished you gain ridiculous powers but they can also become ridiculous negatives.Maybe someone watches you fall off a building and barely survive hitting the ground. As the story is passed it goes from a 2 story building to a 4 story one and then to a tower. Enjoy doing super hero landing and not taking fall damage you jump off of something. The core gameplay loop would consist of you just trying to go through life and follow some sort of simple plot (no idea on story yet) while the actions you take and how you decide to play the game can only influence and not decide what abilities you get. If you decide to use your fists to do the talking you’ll see rumors revolving around your brawling ability but as to what those rumors are you’ll have very little input. It may be that you gain incredible endurance because you fought 10 men at once, might be that you get hands of stone because they said you were KOing everyone in a single punch. I have a general idea of a subplot based on all the gods in a type of Olympus looking down from on high and basically using you as a guinea pig for gambling and placing wagers on. They’d give little inputs to screw up sure things, or make you succeed in a one in a million shot.Let me know if this doesn’t make sense. Will update more after I sleep a bit.EDIT: I wanted to talk about progression a bit. There is a theory with the Avengers that reason they keep fighting greater and greater powers, and finding more and more enhanced villains is that there is a sort of cosmic force that balances out evil rising to meet greatness. In the MCU at least it starts with Iron Man fighting terrorists and another engineer who built a suit. As the universe expands so does the roster and severity of each event.I would use a similar system whereas your legend grows so too do the challenges grow to meet it. If you become famed for your skill with a blade you’ll begin to hear about a certain master swordsman who’s making his way your direction. He finds you and challenges you to a duel at sunrise to prove who the greatest fighter in the land is. This could be a recurring rivalry similar to Gary in Pokemon or it could be a primary antagonist and this is a fight to the death, cementing your legend and leading in to a natural retirement for your PC.You’re a famed monster slayer or hunter of beats? You’re no longer fighting particularly aggressive boars, you begin to encounter more supernatural or mythological type creatures. A wolf the size of the mill, a hydra or a thunder hawk is terrorizing a town nearby and you are tasked with bringing an end to it. This could lead to an eventual face off with a dragon, golem or something.I’ve been thinking of this in rogue-lite fashion where every play through is drastically different and the main plot may be just there to give you some direction and get you traveling about the world. So it’s fine to leave characters you’re not liking and just start fresh immediately. The end game goal would be becoming a true legend which would lead in to character retirement and an epilogue.
 
A game with ragdoll physics, torture devices, a huge weapon selection, and THIS GUY as the ragdoll/target 
 
You run a shop. It's your job to make weapons and armor which will keep heroes alive. 
A hero comes to your shop and tells you about his mission. You get clues about his temperament from his attitudes and mannerisms. You must build armor and weapons which will protect them where they are weak, and make them more deadly. Dumber and more suicidal heroes grant higher bonuses if they survive. It is your job to become the premier weapons and armor manufacturer for the realm.Heroes you save will bring you materials and artifacts for better weapons, and will sell their old weapons and other loot to you so that you can improve your offerings.
 
What if the game designer lies to you. 
A game which starts off in classic fashion: menu, options, start game, tutorial......but then, after you get the basics of the game, in follow up interactions with you, the game narrator and UI of the game itself start introducing information that is purposefully wrong and get you into trouble.After a while, it becomes obvious that the game designer is diagetic (in the game world) and is a character who tries to either make you fail, or use you to get to his own goals (which don't align with your own goals as a character or player). Hence, the game designer is the bad guy too.. xDI guess this is a similar idea to Stanley Parable (or Nier), and invites you to think about the following: how can the Game Designer lie to the player?I'm not talking badly designed UI or UX here, I'm specifically talking about "lying" to the player as a game challenge that the player must overcome. Maps with wrong information, tutorial pop-ups that invite you to do mistakes. Narrator that purposefully lie. And most interesting of them all....the game trains you on mechanics on one way, and then, throws a challenge that requires you to do the opposite of what you learned...
 
A game where only the antagonist knows it's a video game and breaks all the rules and acknowleges the player and forces them to make horrible choice because "Its only a game 
 
A game where you are the universe's most important merchant. 
So you know how right before a big boss fight, there's always a merchant who sells you a bunch of stuff? You would play as that merchant. There would be some strategy involved when it comes to obtaining the best weapons/potions, managing money, etc. You would also have to park your station really close to where the boss entrance is and you have to track the heroes of the story to make sure you beat them to their location or the world is doomed. I imagine an eccentric character with a suitcase/backpack that unfolds into a portable merchant station. Maybe you would even have a pet falcon or a dog that can scout ahead and gather information about a good place to set up. This merchant's goal would be to acquire the absolute best material to increase the odds of the heroes' survival. There'd be all sorts of obstacles in your path.
 
A visual novel that gradually gets more disturbing depending on how late at night/early in the morning you play it. 
This would have to be based on your time zones (sort of like Mystic Messenger I believe). Basically, it's a visual novel/horror game that would sort of break the fourth wall, much like *Doki Doki Literature Club.* The setting of the game is an average Japanese high school with adorable anime girls that you can bond with. At the end of the day, the girl you interacted most with that day will give you real-life advice, normally something simple, like "Remember to stay hydrated!" or "If you're having trouble finding friends, just put yourself out there!" After giving this advice, you can explore the school, go to clubs, or go straight home to work on homework for five minutes real-time until the sleeping cutscene (six seconds real-time).However, the first time you play through a day at school, the girl you interacted with will tell you: "You best not stay up too late. You don't want to know what happens when you stay up too late." The times for "normal" gameplay would be 7:30 A.M to around 11:30 P.M. The game is still playable for the half hour between 11:30 and midnight, but slightly more unsettling, with the days taking longer and the girls taking on slightly glitched appearances, with sometimes distorted text, and advice also being distorted (instead of "Remember to stay hydrated," it would be "Remember to d̶͈͝š̵̡f̷̘͛ģ̶̓t̶͎̃ǹ̴͉ỳ̵̧s̸̩̅b̵͙̚f̶̗̃ḁ̸͒y̷̰͝ū̷̩d̴͔̋h̸̠͂f̴͉̓v̸̟̈ĝ̴̘ý̷̫ẃ̶̙f̴͇͗u̵̟͒s̷̟̈ȗ̴̬e̴̬̕k̴̰̾h̴͚̄ŕ̶̡g̶͉̋") At midnight, it goes to full-on horror game, and even if you're at home or in the sleep cutscene, the MC will be sent to the lobby of the school. Text will flash on the screen that says "I told you not to stay up late." Your goal is now to survive the school (filled with students taking on forms of indescribable horror, the main girls being the fastest and most powerful) until normal gameplay hours resume, or you can simply choose to save your progress, close out the game and go to bed.If you choose to continue with a save file made during horror hours, then where you pick up depends on when you resume playing. If you continue with that save file during normal hours, then you will be back in normal hours. However, the reverse happens if you play during horror hours on a save file made during normal hours.Thoughts?
 
A game where the villain gets tired of waiting for the hero to arrive to fulfill his role and goes on an adventure to find him. 
The characters (npc) were aware that they are in a video game and that they must fulfill their roles, they did not mind dying because they would reappear later. The villain could always see the position of the player from his castle to have the whole environment ready and organized for when he arrives (something like he loves drama) but on one of those occasions after finishing the game and restarting the world the main character no longer appears on his monitor.The rumor that the main character has died without reviving spreads throughout that world causing no one to respect the roles and start wars for control for fear of dying at some point, and the villain tries to find him through the levels, having to beat the bosses who were in charge of him but now have become stronger to take control since they no longer need to be at a standard level according to their roles and they will also steal and use the items and weapons that the main character had to have used throughout the story
 
An Introvert’s stealth game 
Introverts are those with a strong preference for being alone. Some introverts avoid or even loathe the company of other people. Your case tends towards the extreme.As you walk out the door, make sure your neighbours don’t see you. Hide behind the cars, crawl underneath the hedges. Go as far as jump into the sewer. Throw a rock to distract them, wear disguises, 📦, etc - have all the stealth tropes in there, except killing.Everyone in this game either knows you or they don’t. Acquaintances will approach you, while strangers will not pay attention until you do something weird. If someone sees you snooping, they’ll speak to you regardless of whether they know you. In this case, you make an acquaintance and your friend list increases.The same people keep reappearing across levels, and it gets harder and harder for you to complete your quests, which range from taking out the trash to going to work to fighting monsters, because people keep approaching you, and you’re too shy to say you’re in a hurry.  You get money for quests, but it decreases based on how much time you wasted chatting with people. By being anti-social, you gain more but also lose out on opportunities. There are key players you absolutely need to talk to, but you have to wait for them to separate from their group.You can buy tools, upgrades and disguises which help you avoid people. You can build notoriety so people hate you, but that also makes it harder for you to complete some quests, by say losing access to vital people and locations. You can accidentally meet someone just right for you and start a family, bringing their piercing presence directly into your starting location. You can drop your job, your family and your name and move town for a lump sum, and restart with no one knowing you. The only thing that’s consistent is, at the end of every level, you will get testimonies from people about what a great, pleasant person you are to talk to.
 
Supermarket Battle Royale game. You're dropped in a store with nothing in your basket and have to search for food & fight other people. Toilet paper is a legendary loot. Some boxes contain coronavirus. 
Let's go.
 
The opposite of a stealth game. Instead of playing as the stealthy predator, you control the guards (RTS-style) as they search for and defend against the hiding predator. 
You control an expendable squad of hunters as they enter elaborate, open-ended rooms designed for a stealth game, except in this game you are on the receiving end. The view is top-down and controls a lot like an RTS game in that you give your squad orders and they execute them. *Fog of war* occludes anything that isn't within the line of sight of your squad, so the enemy can sneak up on your hunters if you aren't careful.A lot of the gameplay is about looking for environmental clues (broken ventilation grates, trails of blood, etc.) to track the enemy. Then you either sweep the area and funnel the enemy into a corner that will leave them no choice but to pounce. The enemy AI will also target your most vulnerable team members, so you can go the risky route and lure the enemy by leaving one or two of your guys alone.Your squad members have their own individual heart rates, and if they're too rattled by losing sight of the enemy or seeing their squadmates fall to the predator, they will begin to panic, drop stats and disobey orders. You can calm them back down by putting a squadmate near them, in which case one will calm down at the expense of making the other a little more scared.****I was thinking about what kind of story/setting/premise could benefit from this gameplay in which you're basically hunting Batman from the Arkham games. This is the premise:You belong to an agency that hunts vampires, and it recently found a sprawling gothic castle in which a number of high-value vampires reside. In order to organize a massive assault on the castle, the agency began hiring mercenaries for the operation. Now you must clear this castle room by room, all the while finding upgrades, adding new recruits and promoting your most valuable mercenaries. The further you enter the castle, the more powerful the vampires that stalk you.
 
Roguelike with a single main mechanic: a torch. Use it to attack enemies or to prevent them from attacking you. Turn-based game, but the fire of the torch slowly goes out in real-time 
* Very minimalistic game in which you carry a single element: a torch.* You can use the torch you're holding in the following ways:   * as protection: while holding it and it is lit, enemies can't attack you   * to see your way through the dark dungeon   * to melee attack enemies (the fire goes out faster)   * to throw at an enemy setting it and other close enemies (if any) on fire in a kind of chain reaction. But after you throw the torch you are vulnerable to attacks.* There are torches on the walls of the dungeon as well that you can pick when you're next to them. The fire of these never go out while hanging from the wall.* Even though the game is turn-based, the fire of the torch you're holding goes out in real-time, putting some pressure on you to think fast.
 
Gordon Ramsay VR cooking sim where he berates you 
I’m talking Hell’s Kitchen style rather than kitchen nightmares, etc.Multiplayer where you and your friends are line cooks and have to serve a night whilst Gordon Ramsey gets in your face and has different reactions depending on your success or failure.I hope I’m not alone on this
 
GAME IDEA TEMPLATE 
For some background, I'm an intermediate indie game developer who would like to see this sub grow. I know what it takes to make and pitch a game, and find most idea posts on this sub are missing the mark. Use the below template to ensure your idea can be translated into a game.       There is a TLDR copy/paste version at the bottom.            ----------  [TITLE] A one-sentence overview of what your game is all about. Ex: 'The player is a cat, hunting a mouse that lives in the walls.'[BODY]  **Name** (Your best idea for what the game should be called): 'Whiskers'   **Main Mechanic** (what the player will be spending most of the time doing): 'The player sneaks around the house, deducing the mouse's current hiding place through visual sound waves and scratching noises. When the mouse makes a break for the food, the player does everything they can to catch the mouse.'  **Side Mechanics** (secondary features to make the game more fun): 'Stealth and acrobatic movement, using the terrain such as couches and kitchen chairs to get around faster. Multiple mice on harder levels.'  **Story** (The main story idea if your game has one): 'The cat is left alone at the house, and must protect the food under a time limit until the owners get home.'   **Similar to** (games or references that your game relates to for added clarity, usually a 1-sentence pitch): 'Whack-a-Mole meets Assassin's Creed.'  **Advanced Features** (Features that could be added in if made by a strong enough team, but are not needed for the game to function): 'Mouse mode, where the player plays the same level but as the mouse instead of the cat. Multiplayer mode, with 1-2 cats and 2-4 mice. Co-Op mode with 2 cats or 2 mice, etc. Level design mode. Outside mode.'     ----------  While some of this stuff might seem extra, this information is really important for sharing something as complex as a game idea. It gives someone a foundation from which to build game mechanics, come up with a story and visual style, without becoming lost or confused by your idea.  If sharing a game idea with someone feels like you are telling them about a vague dream, then you probably need to think about your idea a little bit more before sharing.  TL;DR / COPY AND PASTE FORMAT **NAME:**   **MAIN MECHANIC:**  **SIDE MECHANICS:**   **STORY:**    **SIMILAR TO:**  **ADVANCED FEATURES:**
 
idk why we don't have an open world rpg that effectively teaches kids how to read by now 
I'm firm on the belief that video games are the future of education. You could fit 10x the amount resources into a video game no problem. At home learning wouldn't be an issue and neither would funding. These kids will do just about anything for in game assets. They'll figure out how to spell any word you give them if you hold character skins over their head. If we can give them that ability they'll be learning faster than you can say no. I can't imagine if this would've existed when I was a child. I understand that we lacked the technology then but we surely don't now. I feel that kids that don't know how to read would find it very beneficial to continue playing and learning about the things that they want to learn about. It'd be unimaginable to watch kids learning core curriculum at their own will.I'm not set on a specific way on how the game should run but it boils down to having everything labeled with words and giving the child the ability to spell these words for in game currency and better opportunities. When a character walks up to a cat they can pet the cat, feed the cat, and above the cat it says "cat". They can click on the word above/below/next to the cat and the game says "cat, c, a, t, cat". In another area they will be challenged to spell the word and be given in game currency if they succeed. The player should also be accompanied with a entity like Navi from the legend of Zelda that helps them to an extent with guiding them to accomplish each and every task the player is given.  The Navi would be the one spelling out each and every word the player clicks on. The world would be filled with multiple worlds. First we would give them a world full of words that start with the letter A, then the world of B's, the world of C's and so on. This would be the alphabet worlds where they can easily walk in and out of all 26 worlds with ease. Another area could be a city and contain all words associated with a city. The last area I can think of would be a world for nature.Just to create a video game like this and to make it as effective as I think it should be would equate to creating a multi million dollar development company with it's sole purpose being to education millions of children.  I find myself falling short. I wish it could be a free video game but if you can make a profit off of this idea, fucking run with it. This is only the start. I'd like to stay in the loop but more than that I want one of MY ideas to actually make it into the spotlight. I believe that my idea has meaning. This is the game I would've wanted as a child. Our education system is dreadful and everybody can attest to that. Further in developing a game like this I'm sure it'll change drastically over time. I really hope somebody takes the time to understand what I'm trying to say.
 
You're an evil villain and by God you will monologue if it means the death of you! 
I dreamt this idea and I know it's kind of stupid but it's just meant to be a comical game that you wouldn't necessarily invest a lot of time in.The idea is that you're a supervillain and you must maintain the supervillain tropes or be laughed at by your counterparts. Sure you could easily kill the superhero with one shot to the head, but they won't die knowing your super evil plot!I imagine gameplay is something like, you have the superhero captured and you begin your monologue, maybe some dialogue cues are presented, but while you're doing this, you are also walking around the room checking to make sure the superhero is not planning an escape. Did they loosen the ropes their hands are tied in? Is their sidekick in the vents? Did they use their telekinetic powers to open the draw that contains the key to their shackles?I'm assuming there would be a point system based on time or something like that.I also thought you could have other stupid villain tropes, like you have to purposefully miss the superhero while shooting at them down the hallway, but they're so damn slow sometimes it's hard not to!I've only played it once (so this could be off the mark) but I imagined a 3rd person 5 nights at Freddy's type game play.Also, I can't believe there is a 'dream' flair lmao
 
I had this Horror game idea and I have to tell someone 
Maybe someone already thought about this idea but this is how it goes.Basically you know how most horror games are in complete darkness and scary ambient sounds and things cracking squecking etc.Well I tought about a horror game simply called "Hidden in plain sight". Watch this, its a bright sunny day birds a chriping sun is shining the grass is green everything is nice.You fell relaxed and safe. But the creature that is trying to get you is simply hidden in plain sight. You can spot it if you look good enough but it is so well hidden in the surounding and its just easing closer and closer.Now I would love to have people aswell and you walk trough them and maybe someone like behind you creapily goes 'Psst hey' and you turn around and its just a normal person like asking you for directions but maybe the next time it is not. The creature is extremly good at blending in.I dont know the objective, I have not tought about it thoroughly only the broad concept. Also I would not like a bullshit aproach to killing it like if you see it you can pop a 45. In his skull and the game is finished no collecting magic stone from my grandmother that she hid in her ass.English is not first language sry
 
A rogue-like where you play as a fish that was thrown down the drain 
Rogue-like where you- as a fish- need to navigate througha complex pipe system arranged in rooms and corridors, where you must avoid environmental dangers (waste coming down from pipes, broken pipelines) and enemies such as rats, rotten food and others. Can choose from several fish with different abilities. Objective is to reach the ocean alive.
 
Things you dislike from game genres you like 
The point of this thread it's to get an idea of what other players dislike about their favorite game genre and take those ideas to create a concept either to make it better or rework that very thing.i'm posting mine as example:FPS* *Guns that feel & look like a toy:* unless it about toys gunfighting then it doesn't apply, since the first doom, i think it's outdated the idea of small guns doing little damage, the pistol becomes useless the moment you get another weapon. In Return to Wolfenstein Castle, and Wolfenstein: New Order, did an amazing job for giving an use for the 'low' damage weapons.
 
Reverse Soulslike - a game where you play as a series of powerful bosses against progressively smarter heroes. 
 
Two players. One is blind, the other is deaf. 
My first time posting here so forgive me for any issues. I'm not a game dev at all but I think this is a really really good concept for a game and I wanted to share it so it might inspire someone who can actually write a line of code. Basically it's exactly what the title says. There are two players, one is blind and the other is deaf and they have to communicate and rely on each other to survive a world of obstacles. There's no voice chat for obvious reasons so you have to figure out how to communicate with each other so you can navigate through the world.
 
a game where you are the final boss 
the name says it all, you are the final boss of the game you are playing and there would be a few levels of varying difficulty like for example: easiest difficulty would be a person who finished the game letting their friend who never played it play, and the hardest difficulty would be a world record holding speedrunner who knows all the tricks to defeat you
 
A horror game where you aren't the victims 
The idea I had was a game where a monster of some kind is hunting and killing the main characters except it doesn't care about you as the player. For example imagine a sci-fi horror about an alien hunting the crew of a spaceship except instead of being a crew member you are a generic matinence robot and have to work to save them.
 
A battle royale but lava rises from the floor instead of the circle shrinking 
That’s it
 
A sandbox game with completely foreign physics. Objects get lighter when wet. An object's momentum is dependent on how hot it is. Gravity is object-dependent rather than world-dependent. Nothing makes sense... and yet with player experimentation it can. 
This is a game about exploration. But instead of exploring a world or its history like Breath of the Wild or Outer Wilds, the thing you are exploring is new physics itself. The game world behaves unlike anything we're used to... and it's all unnamed, uncategorized, undocumented and unestablished.The promise is that the player could get the feeling Isaac Newton had when he realized the actual nature of gravity.
 
A God sim where you have to prevent the humans from discovering they are just part of a simulation in your computer. 
This idea was inspired by the recent Elon Musk interview at E3 2019 (find it on Youtube). &#x200B;A 'God' sim where you have to prevent the human inhabitants figuring out they are just part of a simulation.  Out of your control,  the humans develop more and more advanced technologies over time.  From fire, metal refining, electricity, space travel, quantum physics, etc.  Like to begin with the stars and planets are just a sky-box, and the game is, you have to add real planets before they develop telescopes etc.  Like laying road just before the run over it.  If they figure out they're just a simulation in your computer, then its game over.&#x200B;New Game +.  When you complete the game, you as 'God' of the simulation discover that you yourself are just part of an even bigger simulation.  Now you must prevent the other 'God' players around you from realising they themselves are part of the bigger simulation.
 
Tower defence game where you are a moving power source. 
You are a mobile power source. Turrets withing a range near you get power and turn of when you leave. You may also only build turrets near you.To make things interesting, you can have stationary batteries that charge up when you are nearby. They will continue to deliver power to nearby turrets until they themselves run out of charge.
 
RPG that instead of having a huge open worlda map, you have a small space but you can move through time. 
So actually an "Open Time" RPG where instead of having a huge map/world, you have a smaller space that you cannot leave, could be as small as a room or a building, or a space ship, or a small city like rapture. Then you can move freely back and forth in time and your actions would affect how the place involves in time. There would also be other time travelers who based on your actions might also affect the timeline so the past might also change without you knowing.
 
Protagonist can't read; so player shouldn't either (?) 
I'm trying to make a game where the player can switch between 5 different characters at any time. They're all teens except the protagonist, who is about 4 to 6 years old.  I thought this might be a cool idea: if the player switches to her, all of the signs, books and lettering in the game become illegible, or, at the comprehension level of a kindergartener. Like all the words and letters get mixed up. (Except for the character's dialogue that pops up in text boxes of course lol.) But idk is this too realistic? Would it be too confusing to the player? I though it might also add some more challenge to the game
 
Roguelike: Whenever you defeat a boss and then die, you start your next run as that boss 
You start the game with your main character. After you defeat a boss and then die, you play as the boss you've defeated on your next run. Either your main character could replace the boss you've defeated, or to make things more spicy, your starter character could be the final boss.
 
I want to play a game where you are in the passenger seat of a car with new friends, and they demand you play the music for the entire trip. You have to keep them all happy with different genres while managing the mind numbing fear that comes with exposing your musical tastes to new friends. 
Bonus points for staying true to your actual musical tastes and not copping out by playing things you aren't that into.
 
An RPG where you only gain passive skills 
The game starts like a standard final fantasy type quest. There is a demon, you are about to leave a starting town to travel the world to find the means to defeat him. You leave the town walls and... the demon king is right there anticipating your quest.So you are stuck in the town. And it has a magical shield to keep the demon out, or whatever. What matters is, you can't travel. You can't fight monsters, you can't level up, you can't gain weapons or magic.You can only explore your town. And in doing so, you find you can interact with almost everything. You are stuck at level 1, but by taking the right actions, you gain jobs and passive skills. These skills help advance each other.For example, in the library, interacting with a bookshelves just makes you notice how many books there are. But if you have boosted your passive int by, say, talking to old people, you find you can pick out a book worth reading and learn about the town's history. Now you can find a trapdoor somewhere.There is a cat. Pet it, and you start gaining Cat Fancier skills. Learn to fish, then give the cat a fish. The cat brings you a bell that does something useful.Learn every job in town, and explore how skills from one help you advance another.You can fight the boss any time you feel like. He will always completely overwhelm you in power. But each round of combat, you can try some of the job skills you've gained, and at least one you could have will help you survive. Survive all the rounds because you have a broad enough skillset, and you win. Yay for you.
 
Road Trip - an online social VR game where you join strangers taking turns driving cross country in cars, vans and RVs. 
It's like a mix between VR Chat and Euro Truck Simulator. When you first start, you're spawned roadside signaling to hitchhike. If you aren't picked up, you can refresh to spawn ahead of some other ride.When you get picked up, you just hang out with people, talk, enjoy the passing scenery, stop at roadside attractions, get food at dive troughs, and all around have a fun road trip. Players can take turns driving the semi-automated vehicle.Once you're done, you can ask to be dropped off. Or worst case scenario, you jump out the window.What else can I say. I really enjoy road trips and they can make a great social setting in VR.
 
A post-apocalyptic game where all your information is from before the apocalypse 
So for instance your map of a city would be for the city as it was before the apocalypse, meaning you can't rely on it completely while exploring. I just thought this was a cool idea IDK
 
A multiplayer haunted house game in which AI demons will kill you and possess your body to kill the rest of your team. You can can avoid getting killed by demons by staying quiet on the mic and moving carefully, but then your teammates might kill you thinking you had been possessed. 
You walk a fine line between not getting killed by the AI demons and not scaring your teammates into thinking you were killed and are now being controlled by the AI. If you cry out for help over voice chat or voice commands, you might get killed by the AI, but if you stay too quiet while you approach your teammates for group safety, they might kill you with their melee weapons instead.****The premise is stupid simple: Self-proclaimed demon hunters from across Instagram group up to YOLO some abandoned hospital/mansion/gravesite/ect. (depending what map got chosen)... all to take selfies at randomized locations there "for the gram." Unbeknownst to them, demons are real. Real *vicious.* Now the influencers must split up to take their selfies at their designated locations as fast as possible before a portal to hell opens up ^(or someshit —I don't know, I haven't thought this far ahead. It's absurd though.)
 
Someone should make a game where your an alien who takes over someone’s body and you have to figure out their routine so nobody figures out your an outsider 
There is so many cool things you could do with a game like this, if someone made a GOOD version of this game I would pay a LOT to play it, that would be so much fun. BTW: not a developer or anything just thought of this idea and wanted to put it out thereEdit: Since I have posted this Among us has blown up, my idea is similar except single player with maybe some sort of story line, and “tasks” would be what your host did before you took control of their body and you figure out from context clues what you’re supposed to do
 
A game where you can take your eye out and throw it. Wherever it goes, that's where the game camera goes. 
You play as a Mike Wazowski-type creature with a giant eye, which can be removed and thrown. The eye is still attached to the optic nerve, of course, so it eventually springs back into the eye socket. But when it is away from the player, the camera follows.   This could lead to some interesting puzzles involving camera perspective. Say you encounter two pathways, one with an incredibly strong enemy who can instantly kill you in one shot, and one with a treasure chest. You need to use your removable eye to determine the safest path. You could also find a way to trap the eye in a certain area while the player goes and does something else. You need to be careful though, because the eye can be separated from the optic nerve if it is hit, in which case you need to wander around in the dark to recover it. Once recovered, you can see normally. Maybe you even collect eyes to get better/clearer vision.   You can also you use the optic eye for as a grappling hook for platforming, maybe by swinging it on a certain type of branch.
 
A 2D fantasy game in which you cook and invent new recipes for your town restaurant during the evening, but every morning you forage and hunt for exciting new ingredients in the wildlands. 
Imagine *Moonlighter* but instead of running a shop you run a restaurant, and instead of dungeon crawling you explore a procedurally generated open wilderness teeming with unique plants, animals and monsters.The game focuses on inventing/discovering new recipes. It's not just about what ingredients you combine for a dish, but also about how you prepare or cook each of the ingredients that make the dish unique. It's like if *Breath of the Wild* and *Overcooked* had a top-down 2D baby. Customers request a type of dish (a stew, a roast, a desert, etc.) or type of ingredient (wild game, tree nuts, etc.) and you're allowed to do whatever you want with it. The more intricate the dish, the more you are rewarded. You also slowly discover what ingredients pair well and which don't as you experiment with dishes.On the adventure side you find a vast wilderness with a few set biomes. Early on the hero is limited by the starting inventory capacity, few specialized tools and weaker weapons, along with the player's unfamiliarity and novice skills. As you buy upgrades using the restaurant profits and learn how the wilderness works, you're able to travel further, forage deeper and slay the most dangerous wildlife. Since the world is procedural, you can plant seeds to harvest later. Those plants can attract certain wildlife to hunt later too.
 
A game where the day restarts over and over again (like Groundhog Day) but you play as a different character every time. 
Let’s say there are about 20 - 30 characters and everyday after 12pm or if you die you restart the day and you are somebody else. From an office worker to a random high school student to the mayor to a hobo on the street. Your goal is pretty simple, solve a murder (or another mystery, maybe find out why this Groundhog Day thing is happening?) in a small town. You can interact with the other characters in dialogue and find clues as to what’s happening. You will have a journal that will transfer between characters but any other items will be gone. Certain characters have certain benefits and disadvantages like the mayor has access to more information or areas but he has more work to do before you can actually do stuff with him. When you play as the homeless guy you can move and do things the entire day but of course you start the day broke and with nothing.If I were to make it, it would be in a pixel art top down view.
 
A Twist Isn't A Game Idea 
I've seen like 50 "An RPG but you start with all skills and have to choose ones to get rid of over time" posts. It's such a bad idea, and it gets upvoted every time.There are reasons games are the way they are, you can't just throw an edgy twist on a core game mechanic for no reason and call it a game idea.
 
a reverse dating sim. 
you have been accepted into a prestigious school, dedicated to be a top student you will let nothing stand in your way. the only problem is you are one of the hottest guys in class and it seems everybody has a crush on you.deflect, delay, and diffuse the other students crushes on you.join extracurricular activities to improve your grades, but be warned, you might attract more students.say you're gay when she refuses to stop, and open up an entirely new can of worms.nearly get kidnapped and call the cops on a childhood friend turned yandere.get straight A's and go forward to a bright future.thats basically my idea, tell me what you think.
 
A Heist Game, but with more planning and less shooting. 
I was inspired by this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/gb12uc/heistrobbing\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/gb12uc/heistrobbing_game/)   I've always wanted to play a Heist game with an Ocean's 11 suave vibe to it. I know of games like Payday, and GTA but these (though I haven't played them) seem too shoot-'em-up for my taste and don't really fit within the style I'd want.  They don't come with meticulous planning, and they're much too 'crash-and-grab'.  In my head I'd think there would have to be a much bigger RPG element to it, and 3 stages with 3 different styles of game-play:1. The Original Team. You have 3 guys to start the team, which will be expanded later. I think this could be multiplayer, as you would make a character who's good at specific job, and hire other players as well, but could easily be single player too, having NPCs you can select in place of your two buddies.2. The Research Stage. This is the RPG end of the game, you need to talk to informants find all the information you can about the mark, blueprints of the building, and work out what security they have. You need to know everything, as the success, and your ability to plan depends on what you can find out. You could even try threatening and bribing to get your info. Whatever works.3. The Planning Stage, and the New Team. This, in my opinion, would be one of the best parts to the game and it's major selling point. You use your knowledge of what you gathered in the previous stage to work out a rough plan of what you're going to do, and you then need to construct a new team to fit this plan. You create what you need with a budget, and cut corners where you can. This part could be half RPG when you're recruiting and getting contacts for the plan, but also strategy style blue-print planning part. I'm not sure exactly, but there should definitely be a load of catchy nicknames for the type of characters you need, and types of plans you could pull.4. And finally, The Execution. This is where things could go wrong. Very wrong. Depending on how you did in your Planning and Research stages, the execution might not go smoothly. You need to play your part to the plan and improvise any difficulties along the way. This part I feel should act kind of like GTA perhaps, with your team checking in on an ear-piece giving updates on the rest of the plan.That's as much as I've got right now, but if anyone would actually want to build this, I'd be glad to help out with concepts for GUI game mechanics or how everything could work. I'd love to try help out.  I doubt anything like this could ever be done properly without a big business behind it, but I'd love to eventually try out the idea myself one day.
 
A strategy game where the aim is to keep the war going so you can sell your weapons and keep making money 
Would have an interface similar to plague inc.
 
My Pet Planet" , a virtual pet game, where the pets are planets. 
Functions like a virtual pet idle game, which progresses without you.Foster _cold dead rocks_ into flourishing and thriving eco systems..Thats it..
 
Two character game, one blind, one deaf 
So basically a first person game where you have two characters ( one is blind and one is deaf) and your naviagating through a mansion or cave or seomthing trying to escape together. Obviously your characters are together, maybe linked so deaf character leads blind chracter. Your job is to escape the place your by finding hints and tools and what not about the location by seeing objects using the deaf character, and then swapping minds with the blind character to listen out for any noises coming from places, which would get louder or quieter if you turn towards it and move closer or further away from it, and then you can swap back to the deaf person, see where your blind friend has moved to, and figure out where the sound you heard was coming from and it would lead to more discoveries into helping you get out. The deaf character would have absolutely no sound in game, including menu and opening inventory and stuff, while the blind character could have a blank screen (maybe something on it to not completely make it black, or even better have a sound wave type thing appear if your facing a sound with the source (a dot) so you know where to move to to show the deaf counterpart the location). Hope that makes sense.
 
Your health bar is your sword 
Just a silly idea for a game where you battle with your actual health bars. I envision this as a top-down twin-stick battler where you swing your health bar around to damage enemies. When you are damaged, your health bar shortens, which reduces your reach.This would be a pretty simple gimmicky idea, which could even work as a mechanic or specific weapon in a roguelite-type game.
 
You're in a group call but some people can't hear each other 
The basic idea is that you're Discord voice chat with a group of people but unfortunately, some have muted each other and some have partially muted themselves (not everyone can hear them). No one has the information of who can hear who - you gotta figure that out by talking to each other.I thought of some specific implementations which seem fun:**Figure out the communication network**One person is assigned as the "IT person" who is here to fix this mess of a call. But first, they need to figure out exactly who can hear who. And they'll need some information relayed to them because they (probably) can't hear everyone else. The IT person will draw a graph of persons/connections and submit this "IT ticket" when they're done. Objective is to submit a correct IT ticket as fast as possible.**Task chaos**Kinda like Spaceteam, where people are constantly shouting instructions at other people to complete their individual tasks. Or it could be like a whisper down the lane/telephone style where one person is given a riddle and another person has the answer.**Hidden Eavesdropper**Everyone is given a unique secret key. One person is assigned as the eavesdropper, who can drop in and out of conversations of any connected group of people. Everyone else is a "secretkeeper". The eavesdropper needs to collect all of the secret keys, and secretkeepers only need maybe about half of the secret keys. (The eavesdropper does have the information about who can hear who from the start.)Additional elements?* bi-directional connections only, or also allow one-way connections* change the network of connections periodically during a round* add talking bots for additional persons
 
We should have weekly idea prompts, similar to game jams 
I would love to see this subreddit post some sort of weekly prompt that could be used to help generate ideas, and provide a place for all of us to post how we would take the prompt and make a game out of it.&#x200B;For example, I was in a game jam and the prompt was "Don't touch it!"  I made a tower defense game out of it, but other people had a tons of other ideas.  It was really interesting to see what kinds of things others made.  So, hopefully something like that can be started.  What would you all do with the prompt "Get off my back!
 
Stardew Valley style game set in a post apocalyptic world. 
I started writing out Video Game pitches recently on my DeviantArt page and thought I’d post at least the Elevator Pitch for some of them here in the hope that they might help someone.The first one is: A light farming simulator set in a world brought to the brink by an alien threat.
 
A game like the modern Hitman games, except with "silent drop-in multiplayer" (you aren't told how many players are sharing your world or who they are) and any player can get bonus scores for making another player get caught. 
It's a stealth game in levels full of NPCs and you start each single-player mission with a randomized character appearance. **It's not an assassination game;** rather, your story mission objectives range from things like stealing documents and finding a target's password, to planting bugs in a room and reverse-pickpocketing to plant evidence on an NPC. You still have some non-lethal combat options which are mostly used to steal disguises.The twist is that you can be dropped into a level that already has other players hidden in it going about their own story missions.####You can't assassinate each other.Instead, if you spot some NPC acting like a human *you can report them.* You see, a main feature of this game is the ability to mislead guards (and other NPCs) by walking up to them and reporting suspicious activity. You get a prompt to give them a description and/or location, which leads them investigate or call it in (which in turn might clear a path for you if they leave). If your shenanigans lead to them getting caught, you get a sweet bonus. You might even disguise yourself as a guard NPC to scare them into trouble if you're confident they won't realize you're just another player.There are more ways to mess with other players, such as throwing something loud near them, locking doors on them or planting a tracking device in their pocket (inventory), to name a few examples. Finding other players is a little rare (especially since they tend to be blending in as best they can), but it's just common enough that you're always on edge.
 
A Dungeon Crawler, quite literally 
You were on some epic quest, but unfortunately your whole lower body got ripped off, and now you have to make it through the dungeon without dying by enemies or bleeding out.This might be the stupidest idea I had so far, but it sounds like fun.
 
An advice for ppl giving ideas 
Hey, I'm a beginner at developing, still learning, and I wanna say that if you just have a tiny idea, like a simple game mechanic, don't always try to develop a lore or just doing a huge story about it, it's fine, small and simple game mechanic ideas are as valuable as full "game ideas". It may even be better to me. Thank you for reading me, keep developing and giving ideas people !
 
A horror game that purposefully drops the framerate when the monster shows up, but the monster itself renders at full speed. 
The game's engine is made to always render at a smooth 60fps, but at times it will repeat frames to simulate slowdown and frame stuttering. This is done to make the player think the game is optimized poorly. It's made to look like the game's spooky rendering effects, which kick in when the player's character is "scared", are too much for the engine to handle.However the framerate *really* tanks when the monster shows up, even if he's not on-screen. And when the monster appears in front of you, no matter how low the framerate dropped, the monster comes at you at full rendering speed. It's almost like he doesn't belong in the game.
 
A cyber-noir game about fast-travel, in which you track down and kill innocent "outlaws" who survived teleportation. 
The game takes place in a future in which teleportation booths are ubiquitous. **Fast-travel using these is central to the plot and to the gameplay.** Not just the player can fast-travel, but so can NPCs. They use it to get to work, to travel for vacation, to take their lunch break in Tokyo, etc. Society has accepted teleportation booths.#### It's no secret: Teleportation booths clone you and then kill you.The population has generally come to accept this. *You* always feel like *you* when you come out of the other side, after all. Unfortunately, teleportation booths do have a slim failure rate. Once in a while, the booths will fail to destroy the original. These survivors are disavowed by society and declared outside of the protection of law.This is where you come in. You play a marshal who is tasked with tracking down and eliminating these [outlaws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw)For each case you'll visit their home and workplace for clues to where they may be hiding. You'll interview relatives, colleagues, aquaintances *and even the rightful* clone himself/herself. The outlaw will also ping on a map if they were tagged by a nearby biometric scanner. Each case is like a detective mystery that may end in a confrontation or gunfight.### Fast-Travel as a Gameplay MechanicThe basic game idea came from wondering, "what if fast-travel wasn't just a small gameplay feature, but instead was the core mechanic of a game?"The game world would be about as large as the several city hubs in recent Deus Ex games, just large enough to make fast-travel useful at walking speed (there's no need for cars in this future). Everyone can fast travel *except outlaws* since the network has already flagged them. The rightful clones of the outlaws are also affected since there's no way to tell them apart.This is important because any time an outlaw is pinged on the map, it means they *have* to be within a certain radius (based on time and walking speed). On the other hand, you can zip all over the place to check nearby scanners or to outmaneuver your target.It's so useful to you that it would be a shame if—in the final act of the game—a teleporter malfunctioned on you and now you become the hunted.
 
There should be a horror game where you go into an abandoned military base and for the first half, the monsters torment you and you are powerless and just run, barely staying alive. Then you reach the center of the base where there's a massive cache of insane weapons and then...then it's your turn. 
 Basically, first half Outlast. Second half Doom.
 
Every time i come with some great game idea at first it seems amazing, but as i work on it, it becomes more and more “nothing special”.Do you developers have the same problem? 
 
Oregon Trail, but it’s The Odyssey 
What it says in the title.  Instead of a wagon train to oregon, you’re Odysseus and you lead your ship and crew back home to Ithaca, dealing with mythological obstacles and making sure you have enough food, supplies, and red-toga crewmen to make it home.It would both be a fun rogue-like and keep to the educational nature of The Oregon Trail by teaching about Greek History and Myth.
 
A game where you are a ghost in a cemetery that can enter the graves of dead people and change their past. 
When walking through the cemetery you could read the graves and the causes of death, or see family members murmuring (in text or voices) some regret about their loved ones giving a clue of how they died and that they could have avoided it. The ghost could "enter" the graves and enter a level that represents the exact moment of that person's death, and the player could choose to take an action to save or not save that person, and if they do so when they return to the graveyard, the grave disappears.To make it more interesting, you could make a limit of trips for the ghost since each time it exhausts its own vital energy, and it could also make a connection between the lives of people, in such a way that if one is saved this is change the future for others. The end could be that the character is saved through a certain combination of people whose futures were changed. And make this one have no memories of his death.
 
A horror game set in the old west where you play as a woman accused of being a witch 
The game would start out with you escaping your holding cell. You'd proceed into the Rocky Mountains while being tracked by men with bolt/lever action rifles. As night falls during your escape, weird and spooky things could be in the forest that slowly reveal that you are indeed a witch which is something the player character did not know and/or refuses to believe.
 
An RPG where standard rpg rules are actually laws, and breaking them attracts police 
So for instance, instead of simply being restricted to four members in your party, you can have up to four, but can also break the law by adding more; however, this would attract powerful police enemies. &#x200B;I also thought that it would be cool if certain parts of the game encouraged you to just *lightly* bend the law; for instance, when saving a prisoner from, like, a tower or something, they'd have to join your party, meaning you'd either have to break the law to take them with you, or leave a party member behind forever
 
Had this idea years ago, before I joined reddit. 
You start at a character creation screen, where you're given all these awesome options for traits, some of them chosen at random, and almost enough points to max out some stats.After making the final touches and saving, you're taken to another creation screen with less options, and about half the amount of points to go into stats.You are informed that the character you previously made is the antagonist, and you may have to face them later.
 
A body horror game where the player slowly turns into a hideous monster as the game progresses 
It would be a first-person survival game where the final objective is to find the antidote to your condition. The only way you would be able to check how you currently look like is through mirrors positioned around the map.
 
An Anti - Battle Royal 
Like the title suggests :a Game where you have to kill yourself as quickly as possible using the evironment, weapons, explosives etc. The last one to be alive looses the game. Mechanics that you can use against other players are somewhere along the lines of: healing grenade, or a bubble that slows their fall, so that they don't die and live longer etc.could be fun, especially with squads (that gives suizide squad a whole new meaning xD)
