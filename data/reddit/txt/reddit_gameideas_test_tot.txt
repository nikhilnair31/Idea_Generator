A sandbox game with completely foreign physics. Objects get lighter when wet. An object's momentum is dependent on how hot it is. Gravity is object-dependent rather than world-dependent. Nothing makes sense... and yet with player experimentation it can. 
This is a game about exploration. But instead of exploring a world or its history like Breath of the Wild or Outer Wilds, the thing you are exploring is new physics itself. The game world behaves unlike anything we're used to... and it's all unnamed, uncategorized, undocumented and unestablished.The promise is that the player could get the feeling Isaac Newton had when he realized the actual nature of gravity.
